TI  - Grassland systems of red meat production: integration between biodiversity, plant nutrient utilisation, greenhouse gas emissions and meat nutritional quality.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Government policies relating to red meat production take account of the carbon footprint, environmental impact, and contributions to human health and nutrition, biodiversity and food security. This paper reviews the impact of grazing on these parameters and their interactions, identifying those practices that best meet governments' strategic goals. The recent focus of research on livestock grazing and biodiversity has been on reducing grazing intensity on hill and upland areas. Although this produces rapid increases in sward height and herbage mass, changes in structural diversity and plant species are slower, with no appreciable short-term increases in biodiversity so that environmental policies that simply involve reductions in numbers of livestock may not result in increased biodiversity. Furthermore, upland areas rely heavily on nutrient inputs to pastures so that withdrawal of these inputs can threaten food security. Differences in grazing patterns among breeds increase our ability to manage biodiversity if they are matched appropriately to different conservation grazing goals. Lowland grassland systems differ from upland pastures in that additional nutrients in the form of organic and inorganic fertilisers are more frequently applied to lowland pastures. Appropriate management of these nutrient applications is required, to reduce the associated environmental impact. New slurry-spreading techniques and technologies (e.g. the trailing shoe) help reduce nutrient losses but high nitrogen losses from urine deposition remain a key issue for lowland grassland systems. Nitrification inhibitors have the greatest potential to successfully tackle this problem. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are lower from indoor-based systems that use concentrates to shorten finishing periods. The challenge is to achieve the same level of performance from grass-based systems. Research has shown potential solutions through the use of forages containing condensed tannins or establishing swards with a high proportion of clover and high-sugar grasses. Relative to feeding conserved forage or concentrates, grazing fresh grass not only reduces GHG emissions but also enhances the fatty acid composition of meat in terms of consumer health. It is possible to influence biodiversity, nutrient utilisation, GHG emissions and the nutritional quality of meat in grass-based systems, but each of these parameters is intrinsically linked and should not be considered in isolation. Interactions between these parameters must be considered carefully when policies are being developed, in order to ensure that strategies designed to achieve positive gains in one category do not lead to a negative impact in another. Some win-win outcomes are identified.

TI  - Microbial immobilization of ammonium and nitrate in relation to ammonification and nitrification rates in organic and conventional cropping systems
PY  - 2003
AB  - Agricultural systems that receive high or low organic matter (OM) inputs would be expected to differ in soil nitrogen (N) transformation rates and fates of ammonium (NH4 ) and nitrate (NO3 ). To compare NH4 availability, competition between nitrifiers and heterotrophic microorganisms for NH4 , and microbial NO3 assimilation in an organic vs. a conventional irrigated cropping system in the California Central Valley, chemical and biological soil assays, 15 N isotope pool dilution and 15 N tracer techniques were used. Potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and hot minus cold KCl-extracted NH4 as indicators of soil N supplying capacity were measured five times during the tomato growing season. At mid-season, rates of gross ammonification and gross nitrification after rewetting dry soil were measured in microcosms. Microbial immobilization of NO3 and NH4 was estimated based on the uptake of 15 N and gross consumption rates. Gross ammonification, PMN, and hot minus cold KCl-extracted NH4 were approximately twice as high in the organically than the conventionally managed soil. Net estimated microbial NO3 assimilation rates were between 32 and 35% of gross nitrification rates in the conventional and between 37 and 46% in the organic system. In both soils, microbes assimilated more NO3 than NH4 . Heterotrophic microbes assimilated less NH4 than NO3 probably because NH4 concentrations were low and competition by nitrifiers was apparently strong. The high OM input organic system released NH4 in a gradual manner and, compared to the low OM input conventional system, supported a more active microbial biomass with greater N demand that was met mainly by NO3 immobilization.

TI  - High biomass removal limits carbon sequestration potential of mature temperate pastures.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Decades of plowing have depleted organic C stocks in many agricultural soils. Conversion of plowed fields to pasture has the potential to reverse this process, recapturing organic matter that was lost under more intensive cropping systems. Temperate pastures in the northeast USA are highly productive and could act as significant C sinks. However, such pastures have relatively high biomass removal as hay or through consumption by grazing animals. In addition, the ability to sequester C decreases over time as previously depleted stocks are replenished and the soil returns to equilibrium conditions. The objective of this research was to use eddy covariance systems to quantify CO(2) fluxes over two fields in central Pennsylvania that had been managed as pastures for at least 35 yr. Net ecosystem exchange measurements averaged over 8 site-years suggested that the pastures were acting as small net C sinks of 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (positive values indicate uptake). However, when biomass removal and manure deposition were included to calculate net biome productivity, the pastures were a net source of -81 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (negative values indicate loss to the atmosphere). Manure generated from the hay that was consumed off site averaged 18 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Returning that manure to the pastures would have only partially replenished the lost C, and the pastures would have remained net C sources. Heavy use of the biomass produced on these mature pastures prevented them from acting as C sinks.

TI  - Nitrogen, weeds and water as yield-limiting factors in conventional, low-input, and organic tomato systems
PY  - 1999
AB  - The importance of nitrogen (N), weeds, and water as yield-limiting factors was evaluated over a 4-year period in tomato cropping systems under conventional, low-input, and organic management. The cropping systems studied were part of the Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project at the University of California, Davis, a comparison of conventional and alternative farming systems in California’s Sacramento Valley. Water applied, soil N levels, plant N uptake, weed abundance, and tomato yield were measured and compared among treatments. Tomato yields ranged from just under 55 to over 90 t ha 1 and significant treatment differences were observed in 2 of the 4 years. Multivariate analyses, used to sort out the effects of N, weeds, and water, indicated all three factors influenced yields in this study but their relative importance was dependent upon the management system. Results indicated that N availability was most important in limiting yields in the organic system and water availability was more important under conventional management. Although weed abundance was relatively high in the organic system in 2 years of the study, weed competition for N was not evident. Instead, relative N input levels and N immobilization by soil microflora appeared to explain N uptake and tomato yield variation. The findings indicate that organic and low-input tomato systems in this region can produce yields similar to those of conventional systems but that the factors limiting yield may be more difficult to manage. ©1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - No-till only increases N2O emissions in poorly-aerated soils
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Denitrification rates are often greater in no-till than in tilled soils and net soil-surface greenhouse gas emissions could be increased by enhanced soil N 2 O emissions following adoption of no-till. The objective of this study was to summarize published experimental results to assess whether the response of soil N 2 O fluxes to the adoption of no-till is influenced by soil aeration. A total of 25 field studies presenting direct comparisons between conventional tillage and no-till (approximately 45 site-years of data) were reviewed and grouped according to soil aeration status estimated using drainage class and precipitation during the growing season. The summary showed that no-till generally increased N 2 O emissions in poorly-aerated soils but was neutral in soils with good and medium aeration. On average, soil N 2 O emissions under no-till were 0.06 kg N ha −1 lower, 0.12 kg N ha −1 higher and 2.00 kg N ha −1 higher than under tilled soils with good, medium and poor aeration, respectively. Our results therefore suggest that the impact of no-till on N 2 O emissions is small in well-aerated soils but most often positive in soils where aeration is reduced by conditions or properties restricting drainage. Considering typical soil C gains following adoption of no-till, we conclude that increased N 2 O losses may result in a negative greenhouse gas balance for many poorly-drained fine-textured agricultural soils under no-till located in regions with a humid climate.

TI  - Response of common wheat varieties to organic and conventional production systems across Italian locations, and implications for selection
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Specific breeding for organic systems may help reduce their yield gap relative to conventional systems by exploiting genotype × system (GS) interaction. Likewise, specific breeding for distinct subregions within a region could capitalize on genotype × location (GL) interaction. Grain yield and test weight of common wheat varieties were evaluated under organic and conventional systems in ten locations spanning from northern to southern Italy, with the objectives of: (i) comparing production systems; (ii) investigating the extent of GS and GL interactions and their relationship with genotypic and environmental characteristics; and (iii) preliminarily comparing, in terms of predicted selection gains, different strategies to cope with GS and GL effects. These effects were investigated in the 2-year Data set 1 including seven genotypes. GS effects were also assessed in the annual Data sets 2 and 3 including 13 and 11 genotypes, respectively. The yield reduction of organic systems relative to conventional ones averaged 28% in Data set 1, 29% in Data set 2 and 14% in Data set 3. Organic systems also tended to a modest test weight reduction. Genetic correlations between systems ranged from high to very high (0.88 ≤ rg ≤ 0.98) for yield and test weight, owing to nil or limited GS interaction. Broad-sense heritability tended to be higher in conventional systems than organic ones for yield in two data sets (mainly due to lower experimental error) while being similar in the two systems in the other cases. Predicted selection gains suggested nil (yield) or very modest (test weight) advantage of direct selection in organic systems relative to indirect selection in conventional systems, when targeting organic systems. The scope for selection only in conventional systems was reinforced when comparing predicted gains for selection scenarios which target both systems in relation to their foreseeable marketing importance. GL effects for yield and test weight were significant and were modeled by additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis. Site classification based on GL effects for yield revealed a larger subregion A including northern and central Italy and a smaller subregion B comprising southern Italy, accordingly with previous, independent studies. Yield selection only in subregion A (with indirect selection gain for subregion B) implied slightly higher predicted gain for A (+4%) and much lower gain for B (−24%) relative to independent, direct selection in each subregion. Selection for specific geoclimatic subregions may have greater importance than selection for specific production systems.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in California agriculture, 1980-2000.
PY  - 2006
AB  - To better understand agricultural carbon fluxes in California, USA, we estimated changes in soil carbon and woody material between 1980 and 2000 on 3.6 × 106 ha of farmland in California. Combining the CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model with data on harvest indices and yields, we calculated net primary production, woody production in orchard and vineyard crops, and soil carbon. Over the 21-yr period, two trends resulted in carbon sequestration. Yields increased an average of 20%, corresponding to greater plant biomass and more carbon returned to the soils. Also, orchards and vineyards increased in area from 0.7 × 106 ha to 1.0 × 106 ha, displacing field crops and sequestering woody carbon. Our model estimates that California's agriculture sequestered an average of 19 g C·m−2·yr−1. Sequestration was lowest in non-rice annual cropland, which sequestered 9 g C·m−2·yr−1 of soil carbon, and highest on land that switched from annual cropland to perennial cropland. Land that switched from annual crops ...

TI  - Landscape fate of nitrate fluxes and emissions in Central Europe: A critical review of concepts, data, and models for transport and retention
PY  - 2001
AB  - Agroecosystems are leaky systems emitting nutrients like nitrate, which affect ecosystems on a range of scales. This paper examines the fate of nitrate on the landscape level focussing on how landscape components either facilitate or impede N translocation from the field to the stream (headwater). According to their role in landscape metabolism, two categories of landscape components are distinguished, ecotones/retention compartments and conduits/corridors. Conduits such as macropores, preferential interflow-paths, drainage tiles and streams rapidly relocate nitrate to headwaters. Retention compartments like the capillary fringe/saturated zone and riparian vegetation eliminate N through denitrification. The differential role of compartments is illustrated with quantitative examples from the literature. On the landscape level retention potential for N is spatially variable and quantitatively limited, while its realisation is uncertain. Notwithstanding, the literature indicates that on a watershed basis the bulk of total N input is retained; thus the potential is discussed for the retention of nitrate on different scales, i.e. the field, landscape, regional and global scale. The transitory retention of excess nitrate in soil and subsoil solution, soil organic matter, groundwater and riparian vegetation may delay nitrate discharge to the aquatic system for decades, contributing to the low emission factors on basin scale. The adverse effects arising from denitrification are discussed, presenting data on the emission of nitrous oxide from the entirety of the different landscape compartments. It is concluded that reliance on landscape metabolism and self-purification postpones the problem of global N overload and partially transfers it to the atmosphere. An assessment scheme is presented which in the face of the unpredictability of ecosystem and landscape behaviour is risk oriented (instead of impact oriented). The scheme uses a budget approach, which accounts for the critical role of corridors and considers the scale and scope of N emissions. A conceptual framework for the remediation of N overload is presented which rests on the realisation of cycling principles and zero-emission approaches on all scales of agricultural production and which pleads for regional approaches that transcend sectoral boundaries and take account of overall regional N fluxes.

TI  - Nonlinear nitrous oxide (N2O) response to nitrogen fertilizer in on-farm corn crops of the US Midwest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Row-crop agriculture is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, and results from recent field experiments suggest that significant decreases in N2O emissions may be possible by decreasing nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs without affecting economic return from grain yield. We tested this hypothesis on five commercially farmed fields in Michigan, USA planted with corn in 2007 and 2008. Six rates of N fertilizer (0–225 kg N ha−1) were broadcast and incorporated before planting, as per local practice. Across all sites and years, increases in N2O flux were best described by a nonlinear, exponentially increasing response to increasing N rate. N2O emission factors per unit of N applied ranged from 0.6% to 1.5% and increased with increasing N application across all sites and years, especially at N rates above those required for maximum crop yield. At the two N fertilizer rates above those recommended for maximum economic return (135 kg N ha−1), average N2O fluxes were 43% (18 g N2O–N ha−1 day−1) and 115% (26 g N2O–N ha−1 day−1) higher than were fluxes at the recommended rate, respectively. The maximum return to nitrogen rate of 154 kg N ha−1 yielded an average 8.3 Mg grain ha−1. Our study shows the potential to lower agricultural N2O fluxes within a range of N fertilization that does not affect economic return from grain yield.

TI  - The impact of land use on N2O emissions from watersheds draining into the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean and European Seas
PY  - 1998
AB  - This paper focuses on the impact of land use on biogenic (both terrestrial and aquatic) nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from watersheds draining into the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. While these watersheds cover about 10% of the global land area draining into oceans, nitrogen (N) inputs to soils (40 Tg N year−1) in these watersheds include about 25% of worldwide fertilizer use, and about 20% of worldwide atmospheric NOy deposition and N excretion by livestock. Total biogenic N2O emissions from this region are calculated to be 1.8 Tg N year−1. This includes 0.8 Tg N year−1 from background emissions from soils, 0.6 Tg N year−1 from soil emissions induced by additional N inputs, and 0.3 Tg N year−1 from aquatic emissions. Our results indicate that human activities have at least doubled biogenic N2O emissions from this region.

TI  - Soil macroaggregate turnover and microaggregate formation: a mechanism for C sequestration under no-tillage agriculture
PY  - 2000
AB  - Soil disturbance from tillage is a major cause of organic matter depletion and reduction in the number and stability of soil aggregates when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture. No-till (NT) cropping systems usually exhibit increased aggregation and soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the extent of soil organic matter changes in response to NT management varies between soils and the mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in NT systems are unclear. We evaluated a conceptual model which links the turnover of aggregates to soil organic matter dynamics in NT and CT systems; we argue that the rate of macroaggregate formation and degradation (i.e. aggregate turnover) is reduced under NT compared to CT and leads to a formation of stable microaggregates in which carbon is stabilized and sequestered in the long term. Therefore, the link between macroaggregate turnover, microaggregate formation, and C stabilization within microaggregates partly determines the observed soil organic matter increases under NT.

TI  - A history of research on the link between (micro)aggregates, soil biota, and soil organic matter dynamics
PY  - 2004
AB  - Since the 1900s, the link between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit from viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information.

TI  - Impact of gas transport through rice cultivars on methane emission from rice paddy fields
PY  - 1997
AB  - Two Italian rice (Oryza sativa var. japonica) cultivars, Lido and Roma, were tested in the field for methane production, oxidation and emission. In two consecutive years, fields planted with the rice cultivar Lido showed methane emissions 24-31% lower than fields planted with the cultivar Roma. This difference was observed irrespective of fertilizer treatment. In contrast to methane emissions, differences in methane production or oxidation were not observed between fields planted with the two cultivars. Plant-mediated transport of methane from the sediment to the atmosphere was the dominating pathway of methane emission. During the entire vegetation period, the contribution of this pathway to total methane emission amounted to c. 90%, whereas the contribution of gas bubble release and of diffusion through the water column to total methane emission was of minor significance. Results obtained from transport studies of tracer gas through the aerenchyma system of rice plants demonstrated that the root-shoot transition zone is the main site of resistance to plant-mediated gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere. The cultivar Lido, showing relatively low methane emissions in the field, had a significantly lower gas transport capacity through the aerenchyma system than the cultivar Roma. Thus, the observed differences in methane emissions in the field between the cultivars Lido and Roma can be explained by different gas transport capacities. Apparently, these differences in gas transport capacities are a consequence of differences in morphology of the aerenchyma systems, especially in the root-shoot transition zone. It is, therefore, concluded that identification and use of high-yielding rice cultivars which have a low gas transport capacity represent an economically feasible, environmentally sound and promising approach to mitigating methane emissons from rice paddy fields.

TI  - The influence of soluble carbon and fertilizer nitrogen on nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions from two contrasting agricultural soils
PY  - 2008
AB  - Contradictory effects of simultaneous available organic C and N sources on nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes are reported in the literature. In order to clarify this controversy, laboratory experiments were conduced on two different soils, a semiarid arable soil from Spain (soil I, pH=7.5, 0.8%C) and a grassland soil from Scotland (soil II, pH=5.5, 4.1%C). Soils were incubated at two different moisture contents, at a water filled pore space (WFPS) of 90% and 40%. Ammonium sulphate, added at rates equivalent to 200 and 50 kg N ha−1, stimulated N2O and NO emissions in both soils. Under wet conditions (90% WFPS), at high and low rates of N additions, cumulative N2O emissions increased by 250.7 and 8.1 ng N2O–N g−1 in comparison to the control, respectively, in soil I and by 472.2 and 2.1 ng N2O–N g−1, respectively, in soil II. NO emissions only significantly increased in soil I at the high N application rate with and without glucose addition and at both 40% and 90% WFPS. In both soils additions of glucose together with the high N application rate (200 kg N ha−1) reduced cumulative N2O and NO emissions by 94% and 55% in soil I, and by 46% and 66% in soil II, respectively. These differences can be explained by differences in soil properties, including pH, soil mineral N and total and dissolved organic carbon content. It is speculated that nitrifier denitrification was the main source of NO and N2O in the C-poor Spanish soil, and coupled nitrification–denitrification in the C-rich Scottish soil.

TI  - Soil Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Corn following Three Decades of Tillage and Rotation Treatments
PY  - 2011
AB  - Few experiments have directly compared the long-term effects of moldboard, chisel, and no-till tillage practices on N 2 O emissions from the predominant crop rotation systems in the midwestern United States. This study was conducted from 2004 to 2006 on a tillage and rotation experiment initiated in 1975 on a Chalmers silty clay loam (a Typic Endoaquoll) in west-central Indiana. Our objectives were to assess (i) long-term tillage (chisel [CP], moldboard plow [MP], and no-till [NT]), rotation (continuous corn [Zea mays L.] and corn-soybean [Grycine max (L.) Merr.]), and rotation × tillage interaction effects on soil N 2 O emission, and (ii) how soil N 2 O emission is related to environmental factors during corn production under identical N fertilizer management. Seasonal N 2 O emissions were measured at intervals ranging from a few days to biweekly for up to 14 sampling dates in each growing season for corn. Nitrous oxide emissions during the growing season were significantly affected by tillage and rotation but not their interaction; however, 50% of total emissions occurred shortly after N application regardless of tillage or rotation practices. Seasonal cumulative emissions were significantly lower under NT but not statistically different for CP and MP. Overall, emissions under NT were about 40% lower relative to MP and 57% lower relative to CP. Rotation corn lowered N 2 O emissions by 20% relative to continuous corn. Higher N 2 O emission under MP and CP appeared to be driven by soil organic C decomposition associated with higher levels of soil-residue mixing and higher soil temperatures.

TI  - A review on environmental impacts of nutritional strategies in ruminants.
PY  - 1996
AB  - Primary (plant), secondary (animal), and tertiary (human) biological systems are driven by energy, either fossil or renewable energy in biomass. Their ratio shifts from about 10:90 in primary, via 25:75 in secondary, to 90:10 in tertiary systems. Energy input in ruminant production is mainly as plants and plant parts from primary production, and the amount needed per unit product (milk, meat) primarily depends on its digestibility. This is high in young, leafy, whole plants, in roots and tubers, and in reproductive organs (whole seeds) or organ parts (by-products) of mature plants. Use of fossil energy per kilogram of DM for primary production ranges from 1 to 3 MJ in forage to over 8 MJ in concentrate feeds, whereas input per kilogram of milk is 1 to 10 MJ. Biomass energy used in ruminant production contains nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), but in a ratio rarely balanced to the animals requirements. In secondary systems, energy is partitioned between foods of animal origin and waste. The latter contains OM, N, P, K, and gases (CO 2 , CH 4 ), which may cause environmental problems. Losses per kilograms of milk vary and are 10 to 45 g for N, 0 to 3 g for P, and 2 to 20 g for K. Environmental impacts of animal production can be reduced by varying the use of inorganic fertilizer and changing the forage to concentrate ratio. Digestibilities can be improved by proper harvest management. Level and ratio of dietary N, P, and K can be adjusted to requirements by selecting proper ingredients, reducing their loss in waste. Limited scope exists to reduce losses in respiration and fermentation gases.

TI  - Nitrogen deposition effects on Mediterranean-type ecosystems : an ecological assessment
PY  - 2011
AB  - We review the ecological consequences of N deposition on the five Mediterranean regions of the world. Seasonality of precipitation and fires regulate the N cycle in these water-limited ecosystems, where dry N deposition dominates. Nitrogen accumulation in soils and on plant surfaces results in peaks of availability with the first winter rains. Decoupling between N flushes and plant demand promotes losses via leaching and gas emissions. Differences in P availability may control the response to N inputs and susceptibility to exotic plant invasion. Invasive grasses accumulate as fuel during the dry season, altering fire regimes. California and the Mediterranean Basin are the most threatened by N deposition; however, there is limited evidence for N deposition impacts outside of California. Consequently, more research is needed to determine critical loads for each region and vegetation type based on the most sensitive elements, such as changes in lichen species composition and N cycling.

TI  - Soil CO2 fluxes following tillage and rainfall events in a semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystem: effects of tillage systems and nitrogen fertilization.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract The response of soil CO2 flux to tillage operations and rainfall events was studied under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. The study was conducted on a barley monoculture agro-ecosystem during summer/autumn fallow periods in four consecutive years (2005–2008). The study compared three N fertilization levels (zero, medium; 60 kg N ha−1; high, 120 kg N ha−1) under three tillage systems (NT, no-tillage; MT, minimum tillage; CT, conventional tillage). Tillage operations led to a pulse of soil CO2 flux. This pulse was linearly related to soil CO2 flux on the day before tillage operations under MT (slope = 4.22) and CT (slope = 16.7), indicating the extent of soil disturbances. However, the associated soil CO2-C losses during tillage operations were reduced and similar among different tillage systems. The soil CO2 flux after rainfall was higher under NT, where it was linearly related to soil temperatures (0.15 × soil temperature–1.06). Soil CO2 fluxes decreased on the following days as the soil dried. N fertilization affected CO2 flux in 5 out of 35 observation days, with higher fluxes with N fertilization under conservation tillage systems. Emissions after rainfall events led to large soil CO2-C losses, and these were of higher magnitude under conservation tillage systems (NT and MT).

TI  - Soil nitrous oxide emissions in long-term cover crops-based rotations under subtropical climate.
PY  - 2009
AB  - It has been shown that cover crops can enhance soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the magnitude of increase depends on the quantity and quality of the crop residues. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of long-term (19 and 21 years) no-till maize crop rotations including grass [black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)] and legume cover crops [vetch (Vigna sativa L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.) and lablab (Dolichos lablab)] on annual soil N2O emissions in a subtropical Acrisol in Southern Brazil. Greater soil N2O emissions were observed in the first 45 days after the cover crop residue management in all crop rotations, varying from � 20.2 � 1.9 to 163.9 � 24.3 m gNm � 2 h � 1 . Legumebased crop rotations had the largest cumulative emissions in this period, which were directly related to the quantity of N (r 2 =0 .60, p= 0.13) and inversely related to the lignin:N ratio (r 2 =0 .89, p= 0.01) of the cover crop residues. After this period, the mean fluxes were smaller and were closely related to the total soil N stocks (r 2 =0 .96,p = 0.002). The annual soil N2O emission represented 0.39–0.75% of the total N added by the legume

TI  - Role of nitrifier denitrification in the production of nitrous oxide
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Nitrifier denitrification is the pathway of nitrification in which ammonia (NH 3 ) is oxidized to nitrite (NO 2 − ) followed by the reduction of NO 2 − to nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and molecular nitrogen (N 2 ). The transformations are carried out by autotrophic nitrifiers. Thus, nitrifier denitrification differs from coupled nitrification–denitrification, where denitrifiers reduce NO 2 − or nitrate (NO 3 − ) that was produced by nitrifiers. Nitrifier denitrification contributes to the development of the greenhouse gas N 2 O and also causes losses of fertilizer nitrogen in agricultural soils. In this review article, present knowledge about nitrifier denitrification is summarized in order to give an exact definition, to spread awareness of its pathway and controlling factors and to identify areas of research needed to improve global N 2 O budgets. Due to experimental difficulties and a lack of awareness of nitrifier denitrification, not much is known about this mechanism of N 2 O production. The few measurements carried out so far attribute up to 30% of the total N 2 O production to nitrifier denitrification. Low oxygen conditions coupled with low organic carbon contents of soils favour this pathway as might low pH. As nitrifier denitrification can lead to substantial N 2 O emissions, there is a need to quantify this pathway in different soils under different conditions. New insights attained through quantification experiments should be used in the improvement of computer models to define sets of conditions that show where and when nitrifier denitrification is a significant source of N 2 O. This may subsequently render the development of guidelines for low-emission farming practices necessary.

TI  - Reduced nitrate leaching and enhanced denitrifier activity and efficiency in organically fertilized soils.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Conventional agriculture has improved in crop yield but at large costs to the environment, particularly off-site pollution from mineral N fertilizers. In response to environmental concerns, organic agriculture has become an increasingly popular option. One component of organic agriculture that remains in question is whether it can reduce agricultural N losses to groundwater and the atmosphere relative to conventional agriculture. Here we report reduced N pollution from organic and integrated farming systems compared with a conventional farming system. We evaluated differences in denitrification potential and a suite of other soil biological and chemical properties in soil samples taken from organic, integrated, and conventional treatments in an experimental apple orchard. Organically farmed soils exhibited higher potential denitrification rates, greater denitrification efficiency, higher organic matter, and greater microbial activity than conventionally farmed soils. The observed differences in denitrifier function were then assessed under field conditions after fertilization. N2O emissions were not significantly different among treatments; however, N2 emissions were highest in organic plots. Annual nitrate leaching was 4.4–5.6 times higher in conventional plots than in organic plots, with the integrated plots in between. This study demonstrates that organic and integrated fertilization practices support more active and efficient denitrifier communities, shift the balance of N2 emissions and nitrate losses, and reduce environmentally damaging nitrate losses. Although this study specifically examines a perennial orchard system, the ecological and biogeochemical processes we evaluated are present in all agroecosystems, and the reductions in nitrate loss in this study could also be achievable in other cropping systems.

TI  - Quantitative trait loci analysis of growth response to varying nitrogen sources in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Nitrogen absorption and assimilation is variable among plants as a result of two factors: the source of nitrogen available and the genetic variation among species within the resulting nitrogen pathways. Several genes involved in nitrogen cycling have been identified, yet little is known about the genes that control quantitative responses to different nitrogen sources. With quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in Arabidopsis thaliana recombinant inbred lines (Columbia × Landsberg erecta) we have identified chromosomal regions controlling aerial mass, root mass, and root length when plants are grown in nitrate, ammonium, ammonium nitrate, or low nitrogen treatments. A total of 16 QTL (P < 0.01) were identified among the nitrogen treatments. Most of the QTL were specific to a single treatment. The percentage additive genetic effects of significant QTL were as high as 17%. Five significant QTL corresponded to the locations of candidate genes associated with nitrogen assimilation, while a few QTL corresponded with candidate genes in the developmental pathways. Most QTL were not shared across treatments, suggesting that there is no optimal genotype for all nitrogen sources.

TI  - Crop rotation and nitrogen fertilization effect on soil CO2 emissions in central Iowa
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Depending upon how soil is managed, it can serve as a source or sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to increase, more attention is being focused on the soil as a possible sink for atmospheric CO2. This study was conducted to examine the short-term effects of crop rotation and N fertilization on soil CO2 emissions in Central Iowa. Soil CO2 emissions were measured during the growing seasons of 2003 and 2004 from plots fertilized with three N rates (0, 135, and 270 kg N ha−1) in continuous corn and a corn–soybean rotation in a split-plot design. Soil samples were collected in the spring of 2004 from the 0–15 cm soil depth to determine soil organic C content. Crop residue input was estimated using a harvest index based on the measured crop yield. The results show that increasing N fertilization generally decreased soil CO2 emissions and the continuous corn cropping system had higher soil CO2 emissions than the corn–soybean rotation. Soil CO2 emission rate at the peak time during the growing season and cumulative CO2 under continuous corn increased by 24 and 18%, respectively compared to that from corn–soybean rotation. During this period, the soil fertilized with 270 kg N ha−1 emitted, on average, 23% less CO2 than the soil fertilized with the other two N rates. The greatest difference in CO2 emission rate was observed in 2004; where plots that received 0 N rate had 31% greater CO2 emission rate than plots fertilized with 270 kg N ha−1. The findings of this research indicate that changes in cropping systems can have immediate impact on both rate and cumulative soil CO2 emissions, where continuous corn caused greater soil CO2 emissions than corn soybean rotation.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and land use change: a meta analysis
PY  - 2002
AB  - The effects of land use change on soil carbon stocks are of concern in the context of international policy agendas on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (−10%), native forest to plantation (−13%), native forest to crop (−42%), and pasture to crop (−59%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+ 8%), crop to pasture (+ 19%), crop to plantation (+ 18%), and crop to secondary forest (+ 53%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12–15%.

TI  - The role of conservation agriculture in sustainable agriculture
PY  - 2007
AB  - The paper focuses on conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance (no-till, NT) and permanent soil cover (mulch) combined with rotations, as a more sustainable cultivation system for the future. Cultivation and tillage play an important role in agriculture. The benefits of tillage in agriculture are explored before introducing conservation tillage (CT), a practice that was borne out of the American dust bowl of the 1930s. The paper then describes the benefits of CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where NT, mulch and rotations significantly improve soil properties and other biotic factors. The paper concludes that CA is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly management system for cultivating crops. Case studies from the rice–wheat areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia and the irrigated maize–wheat systems of Northwest Mexico are used to describe how CA practices have been used in these two environments to raise production sustainably and profitably. Benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on global warming are also discussed. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to sustainably produce more food from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands. Promoting and adopting CA management systems can help meet this goal.

TI  - Influence of organic and mineral N fertiliser on N2O fluxes from a temperate grassland
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to quantify N2O release from temperate grassland receiving different forms of N, and to assess the importance of controlling variables in the environment. In 2002 and 2003 three organic manures (sewage sludge pellets, poultry manure and cattle slurry) and two mineral fertilisers (NH4NO3 and urea) were applied to grassland in SE Scotland. All plots except the control received N fertilisers at a rate of 300 kg available N ha−1 a−1 (available N includes NO3−, NH4+ and urea). Fluxes of N2O were measured using static chambers. Losses of N2O from plots receiving mineral fertiliser were short-lived with a peak value of 388 g N2O–N ha−1 day−1 from NH4NO3. Release of N2O from manure treatments however extended over a longer period and was greater in magnitude. Highest emissions were measured from sewage sludge treatments with a peak value of 3488 g N2O–N ha−1 day−1 and 26 times higher cumulative loss compared to the NH4NO3 treatment in 2002. A residual effect on N2O losses was observed from sewage sludge treatments in 2004 when the plots did not receive any fertiliser. There were considerable variations in fluxes between the years, which could be linked to differences in rainfall and temperature. The type of N applied affected the influence of these factors on N2O emissions. The amount of rainfall several days after the N application did not affect N2O fluxes on NH4NO3 treatments. However, in the sewage treated plots increased correlation coefficients were calculated when rainfall amounts over a longer period of time (up to 20 days) were included. A synergistic effect of rainfall and temperature on N2O fluxes could be observed on all treatments. A significant correlation between N2O fluxes and mineral soil N (NO3− and NH4+) was observed when soil water content was not limiting (r2 = 67%, p

TI  - The digestion of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Melle) and white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Blanca) by grazing cattle.
PY  - 1988
AB  - 1. Pure swards of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Melle) as a primary growth (May), trimmed primary growth (early June) and regrowth (late June), and white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Blanca) as a mature primary growth (July) and vegetative regrowth (August), were grazed by twelve Friesian steers (mean body-weights throughout experiment 152-231 kg) at daily allocation rates of forage which provided dry matter (DM) intakes ranging from 28 to 36 g/kg body-weight). 2. Total nitrogen contents of the three ryegrasses declined with season (37-20 g/kg DM), but in vitro organic matter (OM) digestibilities were relatively constant (0.76-0.79). The clovers had higher N (average 36.6 g/kg DM) and lower fibre and water-soluble carbohydrate contents than the grasses, and in vitro OM digestibilities of 0.70 and 0.76 respectively. 3. Duodenal digesta samples were obtained, using a portable sampling apparatus from the animals grazing the pasture, and estimates of the flow of nutrients into the small intestine were derived using two indigestible markers which were continuously infused into the rumen using a portable infusion apparatus. Forage intakes were calculated from estimates of faecal output of indigestible OM and the predicted in vivo OM digestibilities of the forages consumed. Coefficients of variation for OM flow to the small intestine and OM intake were 11.8 and 10.9% respectively. 4. The apparent digestion of OM in the rumen ranged from 722 to 741 g/kg digestible OM intake and from 681 to 711 g/kg digestible OM intake for the grass and clover diets respectively. Substantial losses of ingested N before the small intestine were measured on all diets except the regrowth ryegrass. Losses were 0.30 and 0.40 g/g N intake on the primary growth ryegrass and the regrowth clover respectively; N contents were 37 and 39 g/kg DM respectively. 5. Comparison of the values obtained at pasture with that obtained when similar diets were offered to housed cattle (Beever et al. 1985) indicated that combined relations relating duodenal OM and non-ammonia-N (NAN) flows to OM and N intakes respectively could be established for each diet. For two diets (primary-growth grass and regrowth clover) the relations were curvilinear; for the remaining diets, the derived relations were linear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Legume cover crops and mulches: effects on nitrate leaching and nitrogen input in a pepper crop (Capsicum annuum L.)
PY  - 2010
AB  - There is not sufficient knowledge concerning the risks involved in NO3–N leaching in relation to the use of cover crops and mulches. A 2 year field experiment was carried out in a pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) crop transplanted into different soil management treatments which involved the addition of mulch of three different types of winter cover crops (CC) [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), subclover (Trifolium subterraneum L.), and a mixture of hairy vetch/oat (Avena sativa L.)], and an un-mulched plot. At the time of CC conversion into mulch, the hairy vetch/oat mixture accumulated the highest aboveground biomass (5.30 t ha−1 of DM), while hairy vetch in pure stand accumulated the highest quantity of N (177 kg ha−1) and showed the lowest C/N ratio (12). The marketable pepper yield was higher in mulched than in conventional (on average 33.5, 28.9, 27.7 and 22.2 t ha−1 of FM for hairy vetch, subclover, hairy vetch/oat mixture, and conventional, respectively). Generally, the NO3–N content of the soil was minimum at CC sowing, slightly higher at pepper transplanting and maximum at pepper harvesting (on average 15.2, 16.8, and 23.3 mg NO3-N kg−1 of dry soil, respectively). The cumulative leachate was higher during the CC period (from October to April) than the pepper crop period (from April to September), on average 102.1 vs 66.1 mm over the years, respectively. The cumulative NO3–N leached greatly depended on the type of mulch and it was 102.3, 95.3, 94.7, and 48.2 kg ha−1 in hairy vetch, subclover, hairy vetch/oat mixture, and conventional, respectively. A positive linear correlation was found between the N accumulated in the CC aboveground biomass and the NO3–N leached during pepper cultivation (R 2 = 0.87). This research shows that winter legume cover crops, especially hairy vetch in pure stand, converted into dead mulch in spring could be used successfully for adding N to the soil and increasing the yield of the following pepper crop although the risks of N losses via leaching could be increased compared to an un-mulched soil. Therefore when leguminous mulches are used in the cultivation of a summer crop, appropriate management practices of the system, such as a better control of the amount of irrigation water and the cultivation of a graminaceous or a cruciferous catch crop after the harvesting of the summer crop, should be adopted in order to avoid an increase in NO3–N leaching.

TI  - Fertilizer and Tillage Management Impacts on Non-Carbon-Dioxide Greenhouse Gas Emissions
PY  - 2011
AB  - Recent efforts have attempted to establish emission estimates for greenhouse gas (GHGs) from agricultural soils in the United States. This research project was conducted to assess the influence of cropping system management on non-CO 2 GHG emissions from an eastern Corn Belt Alfisol. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation plots were established, as were plots in continuous management of native grasses or sorghum-sudan-grass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench nothossp. drummondii (Steud.) de Wet ex Davidse]. Greenhouse gas fluxes were monitored throughout each growing season from 2004 through 2007. Fluxes of N 2 O were significantly correlated with soil temperature (P < 0.001), and thus a temperature (Q 10 ) correction was made (3.48 for N 2 O). Nitrous oxide emissions from corn were lowest from the precision tillage treatment (2.4 kg N ha ―1 yr ―1 ), significantly lower than the conventional tillage (4.9 kg N ha ―1 yr ―1 ) or cover crop corn treatments (5.0 kg N ha ―1 yr ―1 ). Corn-soybean and biomass-based cropping systems resulted in significantly greater N 2 O emissions than native grasses. There was a positive correlation between the N fertilization rate and N 2 O emissions when comparing all treatments in this study. These soils were typically a sink for atmospheric CH 4 for these cropping systems, and thus N 2 O is the primary non-CO 2 GHGs of concern. When evaluating the entire cropping system, native grasses resulted in the lowest N 2 O emissions, while a corn-soybean rotation planted with precision tillage resulted in N 2 O emissions similar to bare soil and were significantly lower than emissions from the other cropping systems assessed.

TI  - GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT AND CONVERSION INTO GRASSLAND: EFFECTS ON SOIL CARBON
PY  - 2001
AB  - Grasslands are heavily relied upon for food and forage production. A key component for sustaining production in grassland ecosystems is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM), which can be strongly influenced by management. Many management techniques intended to increase forage production may potentially increase SOM, thus sequestering atmospheric carbon (C). Further, conversion from either cultivation or native vegetation into grassland could also sequester atmospheric carbon. We reviewed studies examining the influence of improved grassland management practices and conversion into grasslands on soil C worldwide to assess the potential for C sequestration. Results from 115 studies containing over 300 data points were analyzed. Management improvements included fertilization (39%), improved grazing management (24%), conversion from cul- tivation (15%) and native vegetation (15%), sowing of legumes (4%) and grasses (2%), earthworm introduction (1%), and irrigation (1%). Soil C content and concentration in- creased with improved management in 74% of the studies, and mean soil C increased with all types of improvement. Carbon sequestration rates were highest during the first 40 yr after treatments began and tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Impacts were greater in woodland and grassland biomes than in forest, desert, rain forest, or shrubland biomes. Conversion from cultivation, the introduction of earthworms, and irrigation resulted in the largest increases. Rates of C sequestration by type of improvement ranged from 0.1 1 to 3.04 Mg C-ha-l yr-l, with a mean of 0.54 Mg C-ha-l yr-l, and were highly influenced by biome type and climate. We conclude that grasslands can act as a significant carbon sink with the implementation of improved management.

TI  - Carbon losses from soil and its consequences for land-use management.
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper reviews our current knowledge and understanding of carbon processes in the terrestrial ecosystem with a view to reducing soil carbon losses by optimising land-use and land management. Processes that influence the fate of carbon (in both terms of quantity and quality) are important in determining soil fertility, quality and health as well as consequences for future environmental change scenarios. We need to understand the processes that determine soil carbon losses and the fate of the carbon once lost from the soil in order to provide sustainable solutions for mitigating these carbon losses as part of land management \"best practice\" and balancing national carbon budgets. Here we review the amount of carbon within the UK terrestrial pool, the processes involved and factors influencing carbon transport to and from soils, the fate of the carbon once it has been lost from the soil environment and land-use scenarios that affect carbon losses. We conclude with possible management options to reduce soil carbon loss and identify gaps in knowledge in order to better understand carbon processes in the terrestrial environment.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Arable Soils is Likely to Increase Nitrous Oxide Emissions, Offsetting Reductions in Climate Radiative Forcing
PY  - 2005
AB  - Strategies for mitigating the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere include sequestering carbon (C) in soils and vegetation of terrestrial ecosystems. Carbon and nitrogen (N) move through terrestrial ecosystems in coupled biogeochemical cycles, and increasing C stocks in soils and vegetation will have an impact on the N cycle. We conducted simulations with a biogeochemical model to evaluate the impact of different cropland management strategies on the coupled cycles of C and N, with special emphasis on C-sequestration and emission of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Reduced tillage, enhanced crop residue incorporation, and farmyard manure application each increased soil C-sequestration, increased N2O emissions, and had little effect on CH4 uptake. Over 20 years, increases in N2O emissions, which were converted into CO2-equivalent emissions with 100-year global warming potential multipliers, offset 75–310% of the carbon sequestered, depending on the scenario. Quantification of these types of biogeochemical interactions must be incorporated into assessment frameworks and trading mechanisms to accurately evaluate the value of agricultural systems in strategies for climate protection.

TI  - Tillage and Field Scale Controls on Greenhouse Gas Emissions
PY  - 2006
AB  - There is a lack of understanding of how associations among soil properties and management-induced changes control the variability of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil. We performed a laboratory investigation to quantify relationships between GHG emissions and soil indicators in an irrigated agricultural field under standard tillage (ST) and a field recently converted (2 yr) to no-tillage (NT). Soil cores (15-cm depth) were incubated at 25C at field moisture content and 75% water holding capacity. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified that most of the variation of the measured soil properties was related to differences in soil C and N and soil water conditions under ST, but soil texture and bulk density under NT. This trend became more apparent after irrigation. However, principal component regression (PCR) suggested that soil physical properties or total C and N were less important in controlling GHG emissions across tillage systems. The CO2 flux was more strongly determined by microbial biomass under STand inorganic N content under NT than soil physical properties. Similarly, N2O and CH4 fluxes were predominantly controlled by NO3 2 content and labile C and N availability in both ST and NT soils at field moisture content, and NH4 1 content after irrigation. Our study indicates that the field-scale variability of GHG emissions is controlled primarily by biochemical parameters rather than physical parameters. Differences in the availability and type of C and N sources for microbial activity as affected by tillage and irrigation develop different levels and combinations of field-scale controls on GHG emissions.

TI  - Agriculture-induced increase in nitrate concentrations in stream waters of a large Mediterranean catchment over 25 years (1981-2005).
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Anthropogenic activities influence past and present nitrate levels recorded in European stream waters, posing a threat to aquatic biota and human beings. Scarce information on temporal trends of nitrate concentration and its causes is available for Mediterranean catchments. This study presents the evolution of nitrate concentrations over 25 years in stream waters of the Ebro River Basin (Spain), a large Mediterranean catchment involving 85,566 km 2 . Nitrate concentration increased with time in 46% of the 65 sites involved in the study. Agricultural cover of 30 hydrologically independent sub-catchments was the main land use related to nitrate concentration ( R 2  = 0.69). Throughout the 25 year-period, the sites showing increased nitrate concentrations with time (trend sites) also presented an enhanced influence of agricultural cover on nitrate concentrations along the time frame of the study. As a result of these temporal changes, at the end of the studied period nitrate concentrations in stream waters responded similarly to agricultural cover in both trend and non-trend sites, showing non significant differences in the slope of the resultant regression models. At this time, agricultural cover explained 82% of the variability found in nitrate levels. If these trends remain unchanged, in 2015 many of the water bodies considered in this study would not comply with the requirements of the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). Therefore management decisions, mainly associated to agricultural practices, should be implemented as soon as possible at the catchment level to meet WFD objectives.

TI  - Towards sustainable grassland and livestock management
PY  - 2007
AB  - Grasslands are one of the world's major ecosystems groups and over the last century their use has changed from being volunteer leys, or a resource on non-arable land, to a productive resource equal to any crop and managed as such. Many grasslands are now being acknowledged as having a multifunctional role in producing food and rehabilitating crop lands, in environmental management and cultural heritage. However, grasslands across the globe are under increasing pressure from increasing human populations, reduced areas with increasing livestock numbers, and declining terms of trade for livestock production, and they are managed to varying degrees of effectiveness. The complexity of grassland uses and the many aspects of grassy ecosystems require a framework wherein solutions for better management can be developed. The present paper discusses a generic approach to grassland management to satisfy these multiple objectives. A focus on ecosystem functionality, i.e. on water, nutrient and energy cycling and on the biodiversity required to sustain those functions, provides a means of resolving the dilemmas faced, through the intermediary, management-related, criteria of herbage mass, which also relates directly to animal production. Emphasis is placed on the opportunities to satisfy multiple objectives. A consideration of the basic relationships between stocking rate and animal production shows that the longer-term, economically optimal stocking rate is associated with improved environmental outcomes. There may be environmental objectives that go beyond economically sustainable limits for livestock producers and in those cases direct payments from the government or others will be needed. These are likely to be where degradation is clearly apparent. The achievement of desirable outcomes in grassland management that satisfy multiple objectives will require new areas of research that seek viable solutions for farmers and society.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gases mitigation measures in the European agro-forestry sector: a literature survey.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Over the last 20 years, climate change has become an increasing concern for scientists, public opinions and policy makers. Due to the pervasive nature of its impacts for many important aspects of human life, climate change is likely to influence and be influenced by the most diverse policy or management choices. This is particularly true for those interventions affecting agriculture and forestry: they are strongly dependent on climate phenomena, but also contribute to climate evolution being sources of and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG). This paper offers a survey of the existing literature assessing cost-effectiveness and efficiency of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies or the effects of broader economic reforms in the agricultural and forestry sectors. The focus is mainly on European countries. Different methodological approaches, research questions addressed and results are examined. The main findings are that agriculture can potentially provide emissions reduction at a competitive cost, mainly with methane abatement, while carbon sequestration seems more cost-effective with appropriate forest management measures. Afforestation, cropland management and bioenergy are less economically viable measures due to competition with other land use. Mitigation policies should be carefully designed either to balance costs with expected benefits in terms of social welfare. Regional variability is one of the main drawbacks to fully assess the cost-effectiveness of different measures. Integration of models to take into account both social welfare and spatial heterogeneity seems to be the frontier of the next model generation.

TI  - Effects of nitrate contamination and seasonal variation on the denitrification and greenhouse gas production in La Rocina Stream (Doñana National Park, SW Spain)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Climatic influence (global warming and decreased rainfall) could lead to an increase in the ecological and toxicological effects of the pollution in aquatic ecosystems, especially contamination from agricultural nitrate (NO3−) fertilizers. Physicochemical properties of the surface waters and sediments of four selected sites varying in NO3− concentration along La Rocina Stream, which feeds Marisma del Rocio in Donana National Park (South West, Spain), were studied. Electrical conductivity, pH, content in macro and microelements, total organic carbon and nitrogen, and dissolved carbon and nitrogen were affected by each sampling site and sampling time. Contaminant NO3− in surface water at the site with the highest NO3− concentration (ranged in 61.6–106.6 mg L−1) was of inorganic origin, most probably from chemical fertilizers, as determined chemically (90% of the total dissolved nitrogen from NO3−) and by isotopic analysis of δ15N-NO3−. Changes in seasonal weather conditions and hydrological effects at the sampling sites were also responsible for variations in some biological activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase and urease) in sediments, as well as in the production of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O. Both organic matter and NO3− contents influenced rates of gas production. Increased NO3− concentration also resulted in enhanced levels of potential denitrification measured as N2O production. The denitrification process was affected by NO3− contamination and the rainfall regimen, increasing the greenhouse gases emissions (CO2, CH4 and especially N2O) during the driest season in all sampling sites studied.

TI  - Recycling of livestock manure in a whole-farm perspective
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Intensification increases the environmental impact of livestock production systems. Efforts to recycle nutrients in livestock manure for crop production will effectively reduce several pollution problems, although general solutions are difficult to devise in view of the diversity in production systems, management strategies and legislation between countries and regions. This paper argues that a whole-farm perspective taking side-effects and on-farm interactions into account is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of strategies to mitigate pollution from livestock manure management. Animal feeding plays a key role in the control of nutrient flows on livestock farms, since the diet affects the composition of excreta. There is a great potential for manipulating manure composition by diet manipulations. Manure is a significant source of heavy metals in soil, and in Europe the permitted levels of Cu and Zn in livestock diets have been lowered to reduce their environmental impact. A variety of environmental technologies are being developed for treatment of manure, many of which have a significant potential for reducing nutrient losses. Internationally agreed and enforced regulations that link pollution control with the adoption of best available technologies could provide the demand that is needed to drive research and development. In the past, policy-makers have typically focused on individual environmental problems. It is essential, however, that the efforts to close nutrient cycles on the farm are accompanied by a corresponding reduction in total inputs, otherwise losses after field application will increase. Integrated assessment tools are needed which can evaluate all internal flows of nutrients, imports and exports, energy use, hygienic risks and contaminants, as well as costs, at the farm-scale and beyond. It is important to consider pollution control strategies for a farm in the framework of local and regional pollution control planning.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from a cropped soil in a semi-arid climate
PY  - 2007
AB  - Understanding nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural soils in semi-arid regions is required to better understand global terrestrial N 2 O losses. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured from a rain-fed, cropped soil in a semi-arid region of south-western Australia for one year on a sub-daily basis. The site included N-fertilized (100 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) and nonfertilized plots. Emissions were measured using soil chambers connected to a fully automated system that measured N 2 O using gas chromatography. Daily N 2 O emissions were low (-1.8 to 7.3 g N 2 O-N ha -1 day -1 ) and culminated in an annual loss of 0.11 kg N 2 O-N ha -1 from N-fertilized soil and 0.09 kg N 2 O-N ha -1 from nonfertilized soil. Over half (55%) the annual N 2 O emission occurred from both N treatments when the soil was fallow, following a series of summer rainfall events. At this time of the year, conditions were conducive for soil microbial N 2 O production: elevated soil water content, available N, soil temperatures generally > 25 °C and no active plant growth. The proportion of N fertilizer emitted as N 2 O in 1 year, after correction for the 'background' emission (no N fertilizer applied), was 0.02%. The emission factor reported in this study was 60 times lower than the IPCC default value for the application of synthetic fertilizers to land (1.25%), suggesting that the default may not be suitable for cropped soils in semi-arid regions. Applying N fertilizer did not significantly increase the annual N 2 O emission, demonstrating that a proportion of N 2 O emitted from agricultural soils may not be directly derived from the application of N fertilizer. 'Background' emissions, resulting from other agricultural practices, need to be accounted for if we are to fully assess the impact of agriculture in semi-arid regions on global terrestrial N 2 O emissions.

TI  - Interactions between residues of maize and pigeonpea and mineral N fertilizers during decomposition and N mineralization
PY  - 2000
AB  - Nitrogen mineralization patterns of maize and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) residues were examined in leaching tubes, both in isolation and mixtures, in Malawian soils of varying texture. Senesced pigeonpea leaves (C-to-N ratio 24) induced a short period of nitrogen immobilization which was followed by steady net nitrogen mineralization in all of three soils. The immobilization period lasted between 14 and 28 days and was longer in soils with larger clay contents. Maize residues contained 30% of their N in the form of water-soluble nitrate. Both the sole maize residue (C-to-N ratio 75 after adjustment for nitrate which constituted 28% of the N) and the mixture of maize and senesced pigeonpeas leaves revealed a similar prolonged strong net N immobilization up to 130 days before the two treatments started to diverge slightly. Mixing maize with pigeonpea residues with equal amounts of N failed to substantially alleviate the N immobilization capacity of the maize residues. N immobilization in the mixture was much greater than that predicted from the mineralization patterns of the individual components. When increasing amounts (50, 100 and 150 mg N kg ˇ1 soil) of green pigeonpea leaves, senesced pigeonpea leaves and ammonia-N were added to 50 mg N kg ˇ1 soil of maize residues, N released in the mixtures increased with the increasing amounts of N added to the maize residues with greater increases from residues with larger N concentrations. There was evidence that microbial degradation of maize carbon was limited by N availability. The implications of the results for management of crop residues and mineral N fertilizers in the field are discussed. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrate leaching and soil nitrate content as affected by irrigation uniformity in a carrot field
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract High value crops such as carrot planted in coarse soils of the Southern San Joaquin Valley in California are prime candidates for nitrate leaching through irrigation nonuniformity. A 2-year study was carried out to explore the impact of irrigation uniformity on nitrate leaching. Irrigation uniformity was measured using catchcans. Soil nitrate (NO 3 -N) and ammonium (NH 4 -N) contents were measured from soil sampled at different depths and times during two growing seasons. Nitrate leaching was determined using ion-exchange resin bags at 1-m depth sampled three times during each season. Although, soil NO 3 -N as well as seasonal irrigation was significantly higher along the lateral irrigation pipe than between the sprinklers, nitrate leaching was not significantly higher. As expected, soil nitrate content decreased as percolation increased for both years. Nitrate leaching, as estimated by anion-exchange resin bags, was positively correlated to soil NO 3 -N content but was not correlated to irrigation depth, irrigation uniformity, or deep percolation. Field variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity ( K s ), soil organic matter (OM), and soil water retention at field capacity had limited effect on NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N distributions in the profile and on nitrate leaching. The results of this experiment suggest that irrigation nonuniformity has less impact on nitrate movement than suggested by earlier studies.

TI  - Soil microbial biomass and carbon dioxide flux under wheat as influenced by tillage and crop rotation
PY  - 1999
AB  - Soil organic matter is important both from an agronomic and an environmental perspective because it affects the capacity of the soil to sustain crop growth, and it is a source and sink of atmospheric CO2-C. Soil microbial biomass comprises a small proportion of total soil organic matter, but it is more dynamic than total soil organic matter. Therefore, measurements of soil microbial biomass may show the effects of soil management on potential changes in soil organic matter before such effects can be detected by measuring total soil organic matter. The effects of tillage and crop rotation on soil microbial biomass and activity were studied in 1995–1997 in the wheat phase of different cropping rotations that had been established in 1992 under zero tillage or conventional tillage in northern Alberta. Soil microbial biomass was often significantly (P < 0.05) higher, but never significantly lower, under zero tillage than under conventional tillage. However, CO2 evolution (basal respiration) was usually higher ...

TI  - Impact of tillage and fertilizer application method on gas emissions in a corn cropping system
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Tillage and fertilization practices used in row crop production are thought to alter greenhouse gas emissions from soil. This study was conducted to determine the impact of fertilizer sources, land management practices, and fertilizer placement methods on greenhouse gas (CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O) emissions. A new prototype implement developed for applying poultry litter in subsurface bands in the soil was used in this study. The field site was located at the Sand Mountain Research and Extension Center in the Appalachian Plateau region of northeast Alabama, USA, on a Hartsells fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Typic Hapludults). Measurements of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions followed GRACEnet (greenhouse gas reduction through agricultural carbon enhancement network) protocols to assess the effects of different tillage (conventional vs. no-tillage) and fertilizer placement (subsurface banding vs. surface application) practices in a corn ( Zea mays L.) cropping system. Fertilizer sources were urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), ammonium nitrate (AN) and poultry litter (M) applied at a rate of 170 kg ha −1 of available N. Banding of fertilizer resulted in the greatest concentration of gaseous loss (CO 2 and N 2 O) compared to surface applications of fertilizer. Fertilizer banding increased CO2 and N2O loss on various sampling days throughout the season with poultry litter banding emitting more gas than UAN banding. Conventional tillage practices also resulted in a higher concentration of CO 2 and N 2 O loss when evaluating tillage by sampling day. Throughout the course of this study, CH 4 flux was not affected by tillage, fertilizer source, or fertilizer placement method. These results suggest that poultry litter use and banding practices have the potential to increase greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Validity of rotation as an effective agroecological principle for a sustainable agriculture
PY  - 1992
AB  - Abstract Agriculture in industrialized countries is based on specialized agroecosystems, where high yields are obtained from sequences of annual crops (cash crops) with large inputs of chemicals. A sustainable agriculture should conversely rely on major exploitation of native resources, i.e. sun energy, water from precipitations, atmospheric nitrogen, soil organic matter. Crop rotation, based on the inclusion of polyannual legumes, is to be considered among the most powerful management practices for pursuing such aims because of its implications for maintaining soil fertility, saving energy and avoiding pollution. Results confirming the validity of this statement are presented. The residual effect on the succeeding crop (sunflower) of a long-term rotation, which included a four-year lucerne ley, in comparison with a sequence of annual crops, was investigated in a mediterranean environment (Central Italy). Similar yields were obtained in very contrasting conditions. Approximately up to 3000 kg ha −1 seed yield and 1400 kg ha −1 oil yield were recorded either with lucerne as the preceding crop, without any addition of inorganic-N and with mechanical weed control, or with safflower as the preceding crop, supplying sunflower with 130 kg ha −1 of inorganic-N and chemical weed control. The effects of the treatments on yield are also discussed.

TI  - Tillage and crop residue effects on soil carbon and carbon dioxide emission in corn-soybean rotations.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Soil C change and CO2 emission due to different tillage systems need to be evaluated to encourage the adoption of conservation practices to sustain soil productivity and protect the environment. We hypothesize that soil C storage and CO2 emission respond to conservation tillage differently from conventional tillage because of their differential effects on soil properties. This study was conducted from 1998 through 2001 to evaluate tillage effects on soil C storage and CO2 emission in Clarion-Nicollet-Webster soil association in a corn [Zea mays L.]-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation in Iowa. Treatments included no-tillage with and without residue, strip-tillage, deep rip, chisel plow, and moldboard plow. No-tillage with residue and strip-tillage significantly increased total soil organic C (TC) and mineral fraction C (MFC) at the 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm soil depths compared with chisel plow after 3 yr of tillage practices. Soil CO2 emission was lower for less intensive tillage treatments compared with moldboard plow, with the greatest differences occurring immediately after tillage operations. Cumulative soil CO2 emission was 19 to 41% lower for less intensive tillage treatments than moldboard plow, and it was 24% less for no-tillage with residue than without residue during the 480-h measurement period. Estimated soil mineralizable C pool was reduced by 22 to 66% with less intensive tillage treatments compared with moldboard plow. Adopting less intensive tillage systems such as no-tillage, strip-tillage, deep rip, and chisel plow and better crop residue cover are effective in reducing CO2 emission and thus improving soil C sequestration in a corn-soybean rotation.

PY  - 2005
AB  - Lynch, D. H., Cohen, R. D. H., Fredeen, A., Patterson, G. and Martin, R. C. 2005. Management of Canadian prairie region grazed grasslands: Soil C sequestration, livestock productivity and profitability. Can. J. Soil Sci. 85: 183‐192. The GrassGro model (a computer simulation of management-induced changes in range and pasture forage and livestock productivity) was combined with spreadsheet analyses to estimate the influence of improved grazing practices on soil organic carbon (SOC), and farm profitability, across native rangelands and tame pastures of the southern Canadian Prairies. Improved practices included complementary grazing (CG) and reduced stocking density (RSD) on rangeland; and N fertilization (FERT), seeded grass/legumes grazed continuously (GLGC) or rotationally (GLGR), and RSD on tame pastures. The analysis was stratified into three ecoregions on the basis of similarities in climate and soil type. Averaged over 30 yr and ecoregions, SOC rates of gain through improved management were 5 (RSD) to 26 (CG) kg C ha ‐1 yr ‐1 for rangelands, and 86 (RSD), 75 (GLGC), 62 (GLGR) and 222 (FERT) kg C ha ‐1 yr ‐1 for tame pastures. Gains with FERT were considered largely negated by associated energy (C) costs, N 2 O emissions, and shifts in grassland species. The CG system alone improved net returns to the producer. The estimated potential combined SOC gain on prairie grazinglands (11.5 Mha) was 1.63 MMT CO 2 yr ‐1 (or 0.465 MMT C yr ‐1 ), slightly less than the 1.70 MMT CO 2 yr ‐1 currently emitted from agricultural soils in Canada.

TI  - Microbial responses and nitrous oxide emissions during wetting and drying of organically and conventionally managed soil under tomatoes
PY  - 2005
AB  - The types and amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) inputs, as well as irrigation management are likely to influence gaseous emissions and microbial ecology of agricultural soil. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) efflux, with and without acetylene inhibition, inorganic N, and microbial biomass C were measured after irrigation or simulated rainfall in two agricultural fields under tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum). The two fields, located in the California Central Valley, had either a history of high organic matter (OM) inputs (“organic” management) or one of low OM and inorganic fertilizer inputs (“conventional” management). In microcosms, where short-term microbial responses to wetting and drying were studied, the highest CO2 efflux took place at about 60% water-filled pore space (WFPS). At this moisture level, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) indicative of microbial nutrient availability were elevated and a PLFA stress indicator was depressed, suggesting peak microbial activity. The highest N2O efflux in the organically managed soil (0.94 mg N2O-N m−2 h−1) occurred after manure and legume cover crop incorporation, and in the conventionally managed soil (2.12 mg N2O-N m−2 h−1) after inorganic N fertilizer inputs. Elevated N2O emissions occurred at a WFPS >60% and lasted <2 days after wetting, probably because the top layer (0–150 mm) of this silt loam soil dried quickly. Therefore, in these cropping systems, irrigation management might control the duration of elevated N2O efflux, even when C and inorganic N availability are high, whereas inorganic N concentrations should be kept low during times when soil moisture cannot be controlled.

TI  - Feeding fossil fuels to the soil: An analysis of energy embedded and technological learning in the fertilizer industry
PY  - 2006
AB  - In this paper, we assess energy demand due to fertilizer consumption in the period 1961–2001. Based on historical trends of gross energy requirements, we calculated that in 2001, global energy embedded in fertilizer consumption amounted to 3660 PJ, which represents about 1% of the global energy demand. Total energy demand has increased at an average rate of 3.8% p.a. Drivers behind the trend are rising fertilizer consumption and a shift towards more energy intensive fertilizers. Our results show that despite significant energy efficiency improvements in fertilizer manufacture (with exception of phosphate fertilizer in the last 20 years) improvements in energy efficiency have not been sufficient to offset growing energy demand due to rising fertilizer consumption. Furthermore, we found that specific energy consumption of ammonia and urea developed in close concordance with the learning curve model, showing progress ratios of 71% for ammonia production and 88% for urea. This suggests an alternative approach for including technological change in energy intensive industries in middle and long-term models dealing with energy consumption and CO2 emissions, while few learning curves exist for energy efficiency of end use technologies. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of land-use management on CO2 emissions from a silt loam soil in New Zealand.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract Effects of land-use management on agricultural sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions are major issues for researchers, regional councils and farmers in New Zealand. This study was undertaken to investigate the environmental impact of land-use management on field-CO2 emissions in Ohakea silt loam soil (Typic andoaqualf) that had been converted from permanent pasture to forage cropping for 2 years. The treatments were plow tillage (PT) and no-tillage (NT), with summer fodder maize (Zea mays L.) double-cropped in rotation with winter oat (Avena sativa L.); permanent pasture (PP) was used as control. Field-CO2 emissions measured every 3–4 weeks during 12 months, were significantly highest in the PP. Overall, results indicate that reduction in tillage had only a minor effect on field-CO2 emission throughout the crop growth period. During one year CO2 emissions ranged from 55–132 kg C ha−1 per day in the PP treatment, 43–91 kg C ha−1 per day in the NT treatment and 36–81 kg C ha−1 per day in the PT treatment. Daily field-CO2 emissions measured within a few days after cultivation were significantly highest in the PP treatment and were in the order of PP > NT > PT. Conversion of PP to NT cropping had no effect on surface organic C levels, but conversion to cropping with tillage markedly reduced C levels.

TI  - Effects of 15 years of conservation tillage on soil structure and productivity of wheat cultivation in northern China
PY  - 2007
AB  - An understanding of long-term tillage and straw management impact on soil structure and productivity is necessary for the further development of conservation tillage practice in dryland farming areas. Data from a 15-year field experiment conducted in Shanxi, on the loess plateau of northern China, were used to compare the long-term effects of no-till and residue cover (NTSC) with conventional tillage (CT) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture. Long-term CT and straw removal resulted in poor soil structure and low productivity. Mean soil bulk density in NTSC was 1.5% less than in CT and capillary porosity ( 2 mm was much greater for NTSC in the 0–0.20 m profile. Soil organic matter and total N and P were 27.9%, 25.6%, and 4.4% greater in NTSC, respectively, and earthworms (19/m2) were found only in the no tillage treatment. Crop yield and water use efficiency tended to be higher under NTSC than under CT, especially in the years of low rainfall, suggesting that the change in soil structure has provided a better environment for crop development. Our 15-year experimental data indicate that NTSC is a more sustainable farming system, which can improve soil structure, and increase productivity with positive environmental impacts in the rainfed dryland farming areas of northern China.

TI  - The contribution of manure and fertilizer nitrogen to atmospheric nitrous oxide since 1860
PY  - 2009
AB  - Atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations have been increasing since the industrial revolution and currently account for 6% of total anthropogenic radiative forcing. Microbial production in soils is the dominant nitrous oxide source; this has increased with increasing use of nitrogen fertilizers. However, fertilizer use alone cannot account for the historical trends of atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide. Here, I analyse atmospheric concentrations, industrial sources of nitrous oxide, and fertilizer and manure production since 1860. Before 1960, agricultural expansion, including livestock production, may have caused globally significant mining of soil nitrogen, fuelling a steady increase in atmospheric nitrous oxide. After 1960, the rate of the increase rose, due to accelerating use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Using a regression model, I show that 2.0% of manure nitrogen and 2.5% of fertilizer nitrogen was converted to nitrous oxide between 1860 and 2005; these percentage contributions explain the entire pattern of increasing nitrous oxide concentrations over this period. Consideration of processes that re-concentrate soil nitrogen, such as manure production by livestock, improved ‘hind-casting’ of nitrous oxide emissions. As animal protein consumption in human diets increases globally, management of manure will be an important component of future efforts to reduce anthropogenic nitrous oxide sources. Atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, have increased since 1860. A regression model indicates that conversion of 2% of manure nitrogen and 2.5% of fertilizer nitrogen could explain the pattern of increasing nitrous oxide concentrations between 1860 and 2005, including a rise in the rate of increase around 1960.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emission from direct seeding paddy field under different rice tillage systems in central China.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Agricultural tillage practices play an important role in the production and/or consumption of green house gas (GHG) that contributes substantially to the observed global warming. Central China is one of the world's major rice producing areas but a few studies have tried to characterize the mechanisms of GHG release from rice paddy field and quantify global warming (GWPs) based on GHGs emission on this region. In this study four tillage systems consisting of no-tillage with no fertilizer (NT0), conventional tillage with no fertilizer (CT0), no-tillage with compound fertilizer (NTC) and conventional tillage with compound fertilizer (CTC) applications in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) cultivation were compared in terms of the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from different tillage systems of the subtropical region of China during the rice growing season in 2008. GWPs based on CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O's cumulative emissions were also compared. Tillage and fertilization had no influence on CO 2 emissions. No-tillage had no effect on N 2 O emissions but significantly affected CH 4 emissions. Application of fertilizer significantly affected CH 4 and N 2 O emissions. Higher CH 4 emissions and lower N 2 O emissions were observed in CTC than in NTC. Cumulative CH 4 emission flux in NTC was 51.68 g CH 4  m −2 while it was 65.96 g CH 4  m −2 in CTC, 28% ( p 2 O emission flux in CTC was 561.00 mg N 2 O m −2 , and was 741.71 mg N 2 O m −2 in NTC, 33% ( p 2 O emissions between NT0 and CT0 systems, but significant in CH 4 emissions. GWP of CTC was 26011.58 kg CO 2  ha −1 , which was 12% higher than that in NTC (23361.3 kg CO 2  ha −1 ), therefore our findings show that no-tillage system was an effective strategy to reduce GWP from rice paddies in central China and thus can serve as a good agricultural system for environmental conservation.

TI  - Nitrate leaching from soils under a maize-wheat-maize sequence, two irrigation schedules and three types of fertilisers
PY  - 1997
AB  - Abstract To implement measures to tackle the nitrate leaching problem it is necessary to assess the effect of alternative agricultural practices in vulnerable zones. A 3-year experiment was conducted at La Poveda Field Station (30 km southeast of Madrid, Spain) to assess the effects of irrigation schedules (conventional vs. efficient) and fertiliser types (unfertilised control, urea, Floranid32 (a slow-release N fertiliser), and municipal organic waste (MOW) compost) on nitrate leaching, grain yield and N uptake by plants. Treatments were combined in a factorial model and distributed to 24 plots. Chemical fertilisers were applied at the rate of 150 kg N ha−1 to maize (1993 and 1995 growing seasons) and 100 kg N ha−1 to wheat (1994 growing seasons). The MOW compost was applied at a single dose before 1993 maize planting at the rate of 27.5 Mg ha−1. Conventional irrigated plots were overwatered and the water input in efficient irrigated plots was dosed according to plant consumption. Nitrate discharge was calculated by multiplying the seasonal drainage volume by the concentration of nitrates in soil water solution, both at 1.4 m soil depth. Seasonal drainage was calculated by using the water balance equation after measuring water movement (tensiometers) and water storage throughout the soil profile (neutron probe). Nitrate concentration was measured in samples extracted with ceramic cups. Drainage losses throughout the experiment were 184 and 38 mm in plots irrigated with conventional and efficient schedules, respectively. Corresponding nitrate-nitrogen discharge in both sets of plots were 128 and 25 kg N ha−1 across fertiliser types. The nitrate discharge in unfertilised plots from the soil N reserve was on average half than that in fertilised ones. The MOW compost treatment combined with efficient irrigation showed promise in controlling nitrate discharge. Maize yields were unaffected by fertiliser type, but wheat yields decreased by 33% in unfertilised plots. It is concluded that, at a given rate of chemical fertiliser, nitrate loading to the aquifer can be traced to drainage discharge and that safe loading of MOW compost to soils requires control of water inputs.

TI  - Net Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensity in Irrigated Cropping Systems in Northeastern Colorado
PY  - 2006
AB  - The impact of management on global warming potential (GWP), crop production, and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in irrigated agriculture is not well documented. A no-till (NT) cropping systems study initiated in 1999 to evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential in irrigated agriculture was used in this study to make trace gas flux measurements for 3 yr to facilitate a complete greenhouse gas accounting of GWP and GHGI. Fluxes of CO2 ,C H4, and N2O were measured using static, vented chambers, one to three times per week, year round, from April 2002 through October 2004 within conventional-till continuous corn (CT-CC) and NT continuous corn (NT-CC) plots and in NT corn–soybean rotation (NT-CB) plots. Nitrogen fertilizer rates rangedfrom 0to224 kgN ha 21 . Methane fluxes were small and did not differ between tillage systems. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased linearly with increasing N fertilizer rate each year, but emissionrates variedwithyears. Carbondioxideeffluxwas higher in CT compared to NTin 2002 but was not different by tillage in 2003 or 2004. BasedonsoilrespirationandresidueCinputs,NTsoilswerenetsinksof GWP when adequate fertilizer was added to maintain crop production. The CT soils were smaller net sinks for GWP than NT soils. The determinant for the net GWP relationship was a balance between soil respiration and N2O emissions. Based on soil C sequestration, only NT soils were net sinks for GWP. Both estimates of GWP and GHGI indicate that when appropriate crop production levels are achieved, net CO2 emissions are reduced. The results suggest that economic viability and environmental conservation can be achieved by minimizing tillage and utilizing appropriate levels of fertilizer.

TI  - Assessing the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on soil carbon: a comparison of four meta-analyses
PY  - 2009
AB  - Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments.

TI  - Impacts of agricultural practices on soil and water quality in the Mediterranean region and proposed assessment methodology
PY  - 2002
AB  - In countries around the Mediterranean basin, the degradation of soil and water resources is a serious threat for the human welfare and the natural environment as a result of the unique climate, topography, soil characteristics, and peculiarities of agriculture. The detrimental effects of agricultural practices on soil quality include, erosion, desertification, salinization, compaction, and pollution. The resultant impacts on water resources include pollution due to nutrient and pesticide leaching and intrusion of seawater into aquifers. In order to select the appropriate sustainable strategies for preventing those impacts, research should focus on development of an accurate soil quality monitoring system at multiple scales based on a functional evaluation of soils. The objectives of this work are: (a) to point out the peculiarities of the Mediterranean region; (b) to underline the most important impacts of agricultural practices on soil and water quality, in respect to the above peculiarities; and (c) to propose a simple and cost effective methodology for the assessment of soil quality at a watershed scale, based on zones of specific functional interest. The proposed assessment methodology would provide information about the status of the soil resources, correlate soil quality with management and aid with the development of sustainable management practices.

TI  - Methane fluxes from differentially managed grassland study plots: the important role of CH4 oxidation in grassland with a high potential for CH4 production.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Methane oxidation fluxes were monitored with the closed chamber method in eight treatment plots on a semi-wet grassland site near Giessen, Germany. The management regimes differed in the amount of nitrogen (NH 4 NO 3 ) fertilizer applied and in the height of the in-ground water table. No inhibition of CH 4 oxidation occurred, regardless of the amount of annual N fertilizer applied. Instead, the mean CH 4 consumption rates were correlated with the mean soil moisture of the plots. However, the correlation between daily soil water content and corresponding CH 4 oxidation rate was always weak. During drought period (late summer) water stress was observed to restrict CH 4 oxidation rates. The findings led to the question whether methane production with soil depth might modify the CH 4 fluxes measured at the surface. Therefore, two new methods were applied: (1) soil air sampling with silicone probes; and (2) anaerobic incubations of soil cores to test for the methane production potential of the grassland soil. The probe measurements revealed that the CH 4 sink capacity of a specific site was related to the vertical length of its CH 4 oxidizing column, i.e. the depth of the CH 4 producing horizon. Anaerobically incubated soil cores produced large amounts of CH 4 comparable with tropical rice paddy soil. Under field conditions, heavy autumnal rain in 1998 led to a dramatic increase of soil CH 4 concentrations upto 51 μl l −1 at a depth of 5 cm. Nevertheless, no CH 4 was released when soil surface CH 4 fluxes were measured simultaneously. The results thus demonstrate the high CH 4 oxidation potential of the thin aerobic topsoil horizon in a non-aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Abstract Owing to a wide range of soil types, climatic conditions and crop species, it its impossible to make a quantitative general statement about the effects that agricultural wheel traffic can have on soil compaction and plant response. There is a need to develop a methodlogy to assess the susceptibility of a given soil to compact and to predict the subsequent plant response. This paper outlines one approach being developed in the United States, using basic soil mechanics theory, soil survey data, long-term climatic data bases, and field research results.

TI  - Effects of soil-protecting agricultural practices on soil organic carbon and productivity in fruit tree orchards.
PY  - 2009
AB  - This 4-year on-farm study reports the effects of different agricultural practices on yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) in kiwifruit and apricot orchards grown in a Mediterranean area. Groups of plants under local orchard management (LOM,§ ) practices (i.e. soil tillage, removing of pruning residues and mineral fertilisers) were compared with plots under soil-protecting orchard management (SPOM) actions (i.e. cover crop, no-tillage, compost application and mulching of pruning residues). In the SPOM blocks fertilisation rate was based on plant demand and irrigation volumes calculated on the evapotranspiration values, while they were empirically calculated in the LOM plots. Results show that yield was 28–50 per cent enhanced by SPOM practices while SOC remained close to the initial values. In comparison with LOM plots, changed practices increased up to 28–90 per cent the amount of P and K, and 13 per cent that of N annually incorporated into soil increasing their reservoir in the soil. The study demonstrates that appropriate land management can increase the mean annual carbon soil inputs from about 1·5 to 9·0 t ha−1 per year. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - THE META‐ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE RATIOS IN EXPERIMENTAL ECOLOGY
PY  - 1999
AB  - Meta-analysis provides formal statistical techniques for summarizing the results of independent experiments and is increasingly being used in ecology. The response ratio (the ratio of mean outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group) and closely related measures of proportionate change are often used as measures of effect magnitude in ecology. Using these metrics for meta-analysis requires knowledge of their statistical properties, but these have not been previously derived. We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of response-ratio data is illustrated using experimental data on the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant biomass responses.

TI  - Organic matter and water‐stable aggregates in soils
PY  - 1982
AB  - Summary
The water-stability of aggregates in many soils is shown to depend on organic materials. The organic binding agents have been classified into (a) transient, mainly polysaccharides, (b), temporary, roots and fungal hyphae, and (c) persistent, resistant aromatic components associated with polyvalent metal cations, and strongly sorbed polymers. The effectiveness of various binding agents at different stages in the structural organization of aggregates is described and forms the basis of a model which illustrates the architecture of an aggregate. Roots and hyphae stabilize macro-aggregates, defined as > 250 μm diameter; consequently, macroaggregation is controlled by soil management (i.e. crop rotations), as management influences the growth of plant roots, and the oxidation of organic carbon. The water-stability of micro-aggregates depends on the persistent organic binding agents and appears to be a characteristic of the soil, independent of management.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from rice crop with different tillage permutations in rice–wheat system
PY  - 2012
AB  - Global agriculture lies in intersection of two inescapable issues of the present times, viz. keeping pace with growing food demand and participating in climate change mitigation efforts. Rice cultivation is a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and no tillage of soil is becoming popular due to low economic investments with improved soil conditions. However, how these arrangements will affect GHG emissions need to be quantified. Therefore, monitoring over diverse agricultural practices is essential for optimum utilization of cultivable land and resources, while identifying the chances of emission reductions. We assessed the impacts of four tillage practices in rice–wheat cultivation system on fluxes of GHGs (CH4, N2O and CO2) and yield of rice. The tillage practices were tilling of soil before sowing of every crop (RCT-WCT), tillage before sowing of rice but no tillage before sowing of wheat (RCT-WNT), tillage before sowing of wheat but no tillage before sowing of rice (RNT-WCT), and no tillage before sowing of rice as well as wheat (RNT-WNT). Reduction in tillage frequency led to significant reductions in fluxes of CH4 and N2O, but increased CO2 while permutations of tillage and no tillage influenced grain yield. RNT-WCT produced next to or comparable to the most yielding RCT-WCT. Although it is difficult to select the best performer since no single tillage permutation showed consistent increment in yield with accompanied emission reductions, RNT-WCT, however may be considered as better agricultural practice for the study region. Long term and extensive spatio-temporal monitoring is still required before making any recommendation. It is also essential for understanding the factors that cause declination in yields under no tillage.

TI  - Soil surface carbon dioxide exchange rate as affected by soil texture, different long-term tillage application and weather.
PY  - 2010
AB  - The current study was carried out at the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture in Dotnuva on an Endocalcari-Epihypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-p-w-can). It was aimed to investigate the effect of air and soil temperature, air humidity and gravimetric water content (GWC) on soil CO2 exchange rate (NCER) under conventional (CT), reduced (RT) and no-tillage (NT) management on loam and sandy clay loam soils. Application of NT on both loam and sandy loam soils increased soil GWC and decreased soil air temperature compared to CT and RT both under dry and wet weather conditions. NCER under dry weather conditions, on loam soil under NT was higher by 0.024–0.033 g CO2-C m -2 h-1 than under RT or CT, while on sandy loam soil NCER was lower by 0.011 g CO2-C m -2 h-1 than under CT application. No significant differences were registered when comparing NT with RT management. NCER under wet weather conditions, on the loam soil under NT was lower by 0.043 g CO2-C m -2 h-1 compared to CT, and insignificantly differed from RT; whereas on sandy loam NCER under wet weather conditions was lower by 0.069–0.087 g CO2-C m -2 h-1 than under RT and CT. Relatively hot air waves during summer resulted in sharp soil temperatures increase and soil GWC reduction. Dry and hot weather situation under moderate climatic conditions of the Baltic region could be attributed to NCER potential limiting condition either on loam or sandy loam soil and affecting all three tillage management practices investigated. Even small rainfall (to 13.5 mm event) essentially enhanced CO2 flux under dry weather conditions. It was noticed that warm weather conditions and higher than normal rainfall inhibited soil CO2 exchange rate. Soil NCER responded to changes of weather and soil state more sensitively in NT than in RT and CT application both under dry and wet environmental conditions.

TI  - Reduced tillage and increasing cropping intensity in the Great Plains conserves soil C
PY  - 1998
AB  - Abstract Concern about soil organic matter losses as a result of cultivation has been voiced consistently since the early part of the 20th century. Scientists working in the US. Great Plains recognized that organic matter losses from an already small pool could have major negative consequences on soil physical properties and N supplying capacity. The advent of reduced- and no-till systems has greatly improved our ability to capture and retain precipitation in the soil during the non-crop periods of the cropping cycle, and has made it possible to reduce fallow frequency and intensify cropping systems. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the effects of reduced tillage and cropping system intensification on C storage in soils using data from experiments in North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and Texas. Decades of farming with the wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)–fallow system, the dominant farming system in the Great Plains, have accentuated soil C losses. More intensive cropping systems, made possible by the greater water conservation associated with no-till practices, have produced more grain, produced more crop residue and allowed more of it to remain on the soil surface. Combined with less soil disturbance in reduced- and no-till systems, intensive cropping has increased C storage in the soil. We also conclude that the effects of cropping system intensification on soil C should not be investigated independent of residue C still on the surface. There are many unknowns regarding how rapidly changes in soil C will occur when tillage and cropping systems are changed, but the data summarized in this paper indicate that in the surface 2.5 cm of soil, changes can be detected within 10 years. It is imperative that we continue long-term experiments to evaluate rates of change over an extended period. It is also apparent that we should include residue C, both on the surface of the soil and within the surface 2.5 cm, in our system C budgets if we are to accurately depict residue–soil C system status. The accounting of soil C must be done on a mass basis rather than on a concentration basis.

TI  - Three decades of soil microbial biomass studies in Brazilian ecosystems: lessons learned about soil quality and indications for improving sustainability.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Soil microbial biomass plays important roles in nutrient cycling, plant–pathogen suppression, decomposition of residues and degradation of pollutants; therefore, it is often regarded as a good indicator of soil quality. We reviewed more than a hundred studies in which microbial biomass-C (MB-C), microbial quotient (MB-C/TSOC, total soil organic carbon) and metabolic quotient (qCO2) were evaluated with the objective of understanding MB-C responses to various soil-management practices in Brazilian ecosystems. These practices included tillage systems, crop rotations, pastures, organic farming, inputs of industrial residues and urban sewage sludge, applications of agrochemicals and burning. With a meta-analysis of 233 data points, we confirmed the benefits of no-tillage in preserving MB-C and reducing qCO2 in comparison to conventional tillage. A large number of studies described increases in MB-C and MB-C/TSOC due to permanent organic farming, also benefits from crop rotations particularly with several species involved, whereas application of agrochemicals and burning severely disturbed soil microbial communities. The MB-C decreased in overgrazed pastures, but increased in pastures rotated with well-managed crops. Responses of MB-C, MB-C/TSOC and qCO2 to amendment with organic industrial residues varied with residue type, dose applied and soil texture. In conclusion, MB-C and related parameters were, indeed, useful indicators of soil quality in various Brazilian ecosystems. However, direct relationships between MB-C and nutrient-cycling dynamics, microbial diversity and functionality are still unclear. Further studies are needed to develop strategies to maximize beneficial effects of microbial communities on soil fertility and crop productivity.

TI  - N2O and NO emission from agricultural fields and soils under natural vegetation: summarizing available measurement data and modeling of global annual emissions
PY  - 2006
AB  - The number of published N2O and NO emissions measurements is increasing steadily, providing additional information about driving factors of these emissions and allowing an improvement of statistical N-emission models. We summarized information from 1008 N2O and 189 NO emission measurements for agricultural fields, and 207 N2O and 210 NO measurements for soils under natural vegetation. The factors that significantly influence agricultural N2O emissions were N application rate, crop type, fertilizer type, soil organic C content, soil pH and texture, and those for NO emissions include N application rate, soil N content and climate. Compared to an earlier analysis the 20% increase in the number of N2O measurements for agriculture did not yield more insight or reduced uncertainty, because the representation of environmental and management conditions in agro-ecosystems did not improve, while for NO emissions the additional measurements in agricultural systems did yield a considerable improvement. N2O emissions from soils under natural vegetation are significantly influenced by vegetation type, soil organic C content, soil pH, bulk density and drainage, while vegetation type and soil C content are major factors for NO emissions. Statistical models of these factors were used to calculate global annual emissions from fertilized cropland (3.3 Tg N2O-N and 1.4 Tg NO-N) and grassland (0.8 Tg N2O-N and 0.4 Tg NO-N). Global emissions were not calculated for soils under natural vegetation due to lack of data for many vegetation types.

TI  - Emissions of CH4 and CO2 from double rice cropping systems under varying tillage and seeding methods
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different tillage (no-tillage [NT] and conventional tillage [CT]) and seeding methods (transplanting seedlings [TPS] and throwing of seedlings [ST]) on methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from double rice cropping systems in central China. The CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes for early rice ranged from −2.52 mg m −2  h −1 to 125.0 mg m −2  h −1 and from 99.3 mg m −2  h −1 to 1463.6 mg m −2  h −1 , respectively, whereas the fluxes for late rice varied from −7.22 mg m −2  h −1 to 242.3 mg m −2  h −1 and from 180.6 mg m −2  h −1 to 2219.0 mg m −2  h −1 , respectively. Compared with NT, CT significantly increased ( P 4 and CO 2 emissions, where the seasonal total CH 4 emissions from the CT treatment were 1.75–2.10 times of those from the NT treatment for early rice and 1.64–1.79 times for late rice. Moreover, compared with the CT treatment, the NT treatment significantly reduced seasonal total CO 2 emissions by 19%–33% for early rice ( P P 4 and CO 2 emissions. Compared with TPS, ST significantly decreased seasonal total CH 4 and CO 2 emissions by 15%–40% ( P P P P

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from European soils under different land use: effects of soil moisture and temperature
PY  - 2010
AB  - In order to estimate potential greenhouse gas flux rates from soils under different land use and climate, and to particularly assess the influence of soil temperature and soil moisture, we measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from intact soil cores obtained from 13 European sites under controlled laboratory conditions. The soils covered the different climates of Europe and included four different land-use types: croplands, forests, grasslands and wetlands. In a two-factorial experimental design, the soil cores were incubated under four temperatures (5–20°C) and water contents (20–80% water-filled pore space). We found a non-linear increase of N2O, NO and CO2 emissions with increasing temperature. Nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with soil moisture, while NO emission and CH4 oxidation rates were negatively correlated with soil moisture. Maximum CO2 emissions occurred at intermediate soil moisture.

Different land-use types strongly affected greenhouse gas fluxes. Nitrous oxide and CO2 emissions were highest in grassland soils, while NO emissions were highest in forest soils. In grasslands, high soil microbial activity stimulated by high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, dense root systems and high C input from above-ground decaying biomass was the most likely cause for high N2O and CO2 emissions. High NO emissions from forest soils were mainly attributed to low pH and high soil porosity. Northern soils showed the greatest capacity to take up CH4 under warmer and dryer soil conditions. Nitric oxide emissions were positively correlated with N input.

TI  - Winter cover crops in a vegetable cropping system: Impacts on nitrate leaching, soil water, crop yield, pests and management costs
PY  - 1996
AB  - Plant-soil relationships in the surface soil layer affect other processes in agroecosystems, including crop productivity, nitrate leaching and plant-pest interactions. This study investigated the effect of altering surface soil dynamics, using a winter cover crop rotation, on biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil profile. Two cover crop treatments, phacelia and Merced rye (Phacelia tanacetifolia cv. 'Phaci', and Secale cereale cv. 'Merced'), with a fallow control, were planted in November after harvest of a broccoli crop on a commercial farm site, and were incorporated using reduced tillage techniques the following March. Changes in plant and soil N pools throughout the profile were described, emphasizing nitrate (NO3-N) leaching during winter, and N availability during the subsequent broccoli crop. Changes in other aspects of the ecosystem, such as plant-pest interactions and plant disease incidence, were monitored after cover crop incorporation. The on-fam~ economic costs of cover cropping were calculated. There was a 65-70% reduction in nitrate leaching from the cover-cropped plots compared with the fallow control during winter, because plant roots in the surface soil removed N and water that would have otherwise been lost from the profile. Incorporation caused sudden large surges in inorganic N pools, net mineralizable N, and microbial biomass N and C in the surface soil, which subsided within 6 weeks, by the time the broccoli crop was planted, but which did result in increased yield at harvest in the phacelia cover-cropped treatment. No insect or disease problems which threatened the cash crops were introduced or increased as a result of the cover crops. The economic analysis indicated that the costs of cover cropping were minor compared with conventional winter management of fallowed fields, and compared with the cost of producing broccoli. The cover crops therefore provided a clear advantage during winter by significantly reducing nitrate leaching, but the effects of one cover crop rotation on subsequent nutrient dynamics in the surface soil were mostly short-lived and possibly masked by large fertilizer applications.

TI  - Processes Regulating Soil Emissions of NO and N^2O in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest
PY  - 1993
AB  - While much is known about control of production of NO and N[sub 2]O by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria at the cellular level, application of this knowledge to field studies has not yielded unifying concepts that are widely applicable and that foster understanding of global sources of these atmospheric trace gases. We applied a simple conceptual model to the investigation of sources of NO and N[sub 2]O and the environmental factors affecting fluxes in a drought-deciduous forest of Mexico. Fluxes of NO and N[sub 2]O were higher in the wet season than the dry season, but addition of water to dry soil caused large pulses of CO[sub 2], NO, and N[sub 2]O emissions. Immediate increases of extractable soil NH[sub 4][sup +] and high rates of gross N mineralization and gross nitrification also were observed following wetting of dry soil. Soil NO[sub 2][sup [minus]] had accumulated during the dry season, and that NO[sub 2][sup [minus]] plus the pulse of increased soil NH[sub 4][sup +] were mostly consumed within 24 hours of wetting. This dynamic microbial processing of soil inorganic N coincided with the pulses of NO and N[sub 2]O production following wetting of dry soil. Acetylene inhibition experiments indicated that NO productionmore » was dependent on nitrification, that nitrification was the dominant source of N[sub 2]O when the soil was wetted at the end of the dry season, and that denitrification might be an important source of N[sub 2]O during the wet season. Post-wetting soil moisture was correlated negatively with NO fluxes and positively with N[sub O] fluxes. These results support a conceptual model in which N trace gas production is generally constrained by the rates of N mineralization and nitrification, while the specific ratios of NO and N[sub 2]O fluxes and the contributions from nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are controlled largely by soil moisture. 42 refs., 5 figs., 4 tabs.« less

TI  - Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes in Corn Grown under Two Tillage Systems in Southwestern Quebec
PY  - 2009
AB  - Agriculture has an important potential role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). However, practices that reduce CO 2 emissions from soils and increase the soil organic C level may stimulate N 2 O emissions. This is particularly critical in Quebec where heavy soils and a humid climate may limit the adoption of agricultural practices designed to mitigate GHG. The objective of this work was to study the effects of two tillage and N fertilization regimes on CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes and the seasonal variability in emissions of these gases, associated with corn (Zea mays L.) grown in southwestern Quebec. Different seasonal emission patterns of CO 2 and N 2 O were observed. Higher N 2 O fluxes occurred during the spring and were associated with precipitation events, while higher CO 2 fluxes occurred in mid-season and were related to temperature. Conventional tillage (CT) had greater peaks of CO 2 emissions than no-till (NT) only after disking in the spring. Once corn was established, differences between tillage systems were small. Peaks of N 2 O emission occurred in both systems (NT and CT) following N application. Plots receiving 180 kg N ha -1 in both tillage systems had large peak of N 2 O emission rates during the wettest parts of the season. The CT and NT systems generally had similar cumulative CO 2 emissions but NT had higher cumulative N 2 O emissions than CT. Our findings suggests that changing from CT to NT under the heavy soil conditions of Quebec may increase GHG, mainly as result of the increase in N 2 O emission. This negative effect of NT could be reduced by avoiding fertilizing when precipitation is more intense.

TI  - Impact of tropical land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks - a meta-analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25%) and perennial crops (−30%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29%) or under cropland fallow (+32%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.

TI  - Genetic analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies in mature spring barley plants
PY  - 2001
AB  - Inheritance of the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus utilization in grain production was studied in diallel hybrids of spring barley. Effects of varied NPK fertilization and soil moisture on the genetic variance was evaluated at maturity in pot- and field-grown plants. A preponderance of general combining ability effects was found for the efficiency ratios and utilization efficiencies, suggesting that the generative efficiency indices were mainly controlled by an additive genetic system. However, the relatively high narrow-sense heritabilities (0.33-0.81) found under optimal conditions tended to decline to 0.00-0.36 following water and nutrient shortages. The importance of non-additive gene effects for utilization efficiencies was demonstrated in the field under reduced nutrition. This leads to the conclusion that the involvement of additive gene action should facilitate selection efforts only under favourable environments. Selection delayed until later hybrid generations should be used when trying to improve the nutrient efficiency of barley under less favourable nutrition conditions.

TI  - Long-term effect of tillage, crop rotation and N fertilization to wheat on gaseous emissions under rainfed Mediterranean conditions
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract A field study was conducted to assess the effect of N fertilizer application to wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), tillage system and crop rotation on total denitrification N losses, N 2 O and CO 2 emissions under Mediterranean conditions in a long-term trial started 18 years ago on a Vertisol soil. The tillage system consisted of conventional tillage vs. no-tillage and the crop rotation system consisted of two different 2-years rotations: wheat–sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.) (WS) and wheat–faba bean ( Vicia faba L.) (WF). Fertilizer rates were 0 and 100 kg N ha −1 applied to wheat splitted in two amendments of 50 kg N ha −1 each. Two different fertilization systems were studied. In the old fertilized plots system fertilizer had been applied for 18 years since the beginning of the trial, and in the new fertilized plots system fertilizer was applied for the first time when this experiment was started. Measurements were carried out after fertilizer applications. In the long term, continued fertilizer application produced a higher soil total N content. Nevertheless, no increase in denitrification potential, N 2 O + N 2 production by denitrification, N 2 O or CO 2 emissions was observed either by the recent application of N or by the continued application during 18 years. The soil presented a higher potential to denitrify up to N 2 than up to N 2 O. So, denitrification was probably occurring mainly in the form of N 2 , while N 2 O emissions were occurring in a great manner by nitrification, both denitrification and nitrification occurring simultaneously at soil field capacity (60–70%) expressed as water filled pore space (WFPS). Conventional tillage induced an increase in soil total N content and in the potential to denitrify up to N 2 with respect to no-tillage. This higher potential was translated into higher N 2 O + N 2 production by denitrification presumably stimulated in the short time by the higher available carbon provided by decomposing roots and by the subsequent creation of soil anaerobic microsites. Contrarily, no effect of tillage was observed on N 2 O emissions because of being produced in an important manner by nitrification, which does not depend on carbon availability. The wheat–faba bean rotation induced higher soil nitrate contents than the wheat–sunflower, although the effect in the long time was not observed regarding soil total N content. The same as for the fertilizer effect, this increase in nitrate content was not followed by a higher denitrification potential or higher N 2 O + N 2 production by denitrification because of the lack of organic matter, while an increase was observed in N 2 O emissions.

TI  - Effects of Reduced Tillage and Fertilization Practices on Soil Characteristics, Plant Water Status, Growth and Yield of Upland Cotton
PY  - 2004
AB  - Three different tillage practices, conventional (mouldboard ploughing at 22–25 cm plus one rotary hoeing at 5–6 cm, CT), minimum (one rotary hoeing at 12–15 cm, MT), and no-tillage (direct drilling in soil covered by vetch residues, NT), combined with three fertilization treatments, inorganic (50 kg N ha−1 as ammonium sulphate), cattle manuring (30 t ha−1), and control (no-fertilizer), were applied on a cotton crop (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Acala SJ-2) grown on a clay loam soil in the field of the Agricultural University of Athens. Soil (gravimetric water content, bulk density, and penetration resistance in the top 40 cm) and plant parameters (root growth, leaf water potential, leaf area growth and seedcotton yield) were recorded throughout the cultivation period in all treatments. No-tillage was associated with significantly higher values of soil water throughout the observation period caused by the vetch mulch. Bulk density and penetration resistance were initially higher in the no-tilled plots, but they became significantly lower after 2–3 months from sowing. These beneficial effects on soil properties favoured root growth, expressed as root surface density, in the NT-plots at the top soil layer. Similar, although less spectacular, effects were observed in the manured plots. Plant water status, expressed in terms of the water potential index, was significantly and consistently best in the NT- and worst in the CT-plots throughout crop growth. In addition, NT favoured a better foliage growth and resulted in significantly higher yields than the other tillage practices. In general, NT, and in second instance, MT considerably improved plant water status, and hence foliage growth and yield in comparison with CT by maintaining higher levels of soil water and improving root growth. Manuring positively interacted with the reduced tillage practices for most soil and plant parameters.

TI  - Mapping of QTL associated with nitrogen storage and remobilization in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves
PY  - 2003
AB  - Nitrogen uptake and metabolism are central for vegetative and reproductive plant growth. This is reflected by the fact that nitrogen can be remobilized and reused within a plant, and this process is crucial for yield in most annual crops. A population of 146 recombinant inbred barley lines (F8 and F9 plants, grown in 2000 and 2001), derived from a cross between two varieties differing markedly in grain protein concentration, was used to compare the location of QTL associated with nitrogen uptake, storage and remobilization in flag leaves relative to QTL controlling developmental parameters and grain protein accumulation. Overlaps of support intervals for such QTL were found on several chromosomes, with chromosomes 3 and 6 being especially important. For QTL on these chromosomes, alleles associated with inefficient N remobilization were associated with depressed yield and higher levels of total or soluble organic nitrogen during grain filling and vice versa; therefore, genes directly involved in N recycling or genes regulating N recycling may be located on these chromosomes. Interestingly, the most prominent QTL for grain protein concentration (on chromosome 6) did not co-localize with QTL for nitrogen remobilization. However, QTL peaks for nitrate and soluble organic nitrogen were detected at this locus for plants grown in 2001 (but not in 2000). For these, alleles associated with low grain protein concentration were associated with higher soluble nitrogen levels in leaves during grain filling; therefore, gene(s) found at this locus might influence the nitrogen sink strength of developing barley grains.

TI  - Laboratory investigations into the effects of the pesticides mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and prosulfuron on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide production in fertilized soil
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract Independent soil microcosm experiments were used to investigate the effects of the fungicides mancozeb and chlorothalonil, and the herbicide prosulfuron, on N 2 O and NO production by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in fertilized soil. Soil cores were amended with NH 4 NO 3 or NH 4 NO 3 and pesticide, and the N 2 O and NO concentrations were monitored periodically for approximately 48 h following amendment. Nitrification is the major source of N 2 O and NO in these soils at soil moistures relevant to those observed at the field site where the cores were collected. At pesticide concentrations from 0.02 to 10 times that of a standard single application on a corn crop, N 2 O and NO production was inhibited by all three pesticides. Generally N 2 O production was inhibited by the pesticides from 10 to 62% and 20 to 98% at the lowest and highest dosages, respectively. Nitric oxide production was generally inhibited from about 5 to 47% and by 20 to 97% at the lowest and highest dosages, respectively. Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide production by nitrification was more susceptible to inhibition by these pesticides than denitrification. Production of both N 2 O and NO by nitrification was inhibited by as much as 99%, at the highest concentration of pesticide applied. The net production of N 2 O increased as soil moisture increased. The rate of NO production was greatest at the intermediate moistures investigated, between 14 and 19% gravimetric soil moisture, suggestive that nitrification is the dominant source of NO.

TI  - Organic Wheat Production and Soil Nutrient Status in a Mediterranean Climatic Zone
PY  - 2003
AB  - ABSTRACT Organic production systems are possible alternatives to current conventional dryland cropping systems in south western Australia, but they remain largely untested for their impact on crop production and soil fertility. The aims of this study were to compare wheat production levels of organic and conventionally managed fields, and relate outcomes to possible differences in soil fertility. Seven paired sites were compared over three years (1992–1994); the sites were paired to ensure similarity in soil types, crop history before conversion of the organic paddock from conventional to organic farming, and at most sites, the farm manager of paired fields was the same. In years 1 to 2, there was no difference between the following soil chemical properties of the paired organic and conventionally managed fields: pH, electrical conductivity, mineral nitrogen (ammonium-N and nitrate-N), soil organic C, total P and lactate-extractable-P. Compared to the grain yield of the conventionally grown wheat, yield o...

TI  - Energy resources' utilization in organic and conventional vineyards: Energy flow, greenhouse gas emissions and biofuel production
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract An energy analysis, in conventional and organic vineyards, combined with ethanol production and greenhouse gas emissions, is useful in evaluating present situation and deciding best management strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences in the energy flow between organic and conventional vineyards in three locations, to calculate CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O-emissions based on the used fossil energy and to explore if wine industry wastes can be used to extract bioethanol. The data were collected through personal interviews with farmers during 2004–2005. Eighteen farmers, who owned vineyards about 1 ha each, were randomly selected to participate in this study [(3 conventional and 3 organic) × 3 locations]. The means averaged over all locations for fertilizer application, plant protection products application, transportation, harvesting, labor, machinery, fuels, plant protections products and tools energy inputs, total energy inputs, outputs (grapes), outputs (grapes + shoots), grape yield, man hour, pomace and ethanol from pomace were significantly higher in conventional than in organic vineyards, while the opposite occurred for the pruning. Means averaged over two farming systems for harvesting, tools energy inputs, energy outputs (grapes), grape yield, pomace and ethanol from pomace were significantly higher at location A, followed by location C and location B. Finally, for irrigation, the means averaged over the two farming systems were significantly lower at location C. Greenhouse gas emissions were significant lower in organic than in conventional vineyards. The results show a clear response of energy inputs to energy outputs that resulted from the farming system and location.

TI  - Nitrogen in rainfed and irrigated cropping systems in the Mediterranean region.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract The Middle East region, embracing West Asia and North Africa (WANA), is characterized by a Mediterranean climate which dictates the agriculture of the region. Being one of the centers of origin of settled farming, where cereals and pulses originated along with sheep and goats, crop production is largely rainfed and is dependent on the limited rainfall (200–600 mm) during the cool moist season in late fall to late spring. The agricultural sector has changed in recent decades with intensification and pressure on land use. As elsewhere, increased chemical fertilizer use, especially nitrogen (N), has had an impact on the transition from a traditional system to a more market driven one with increased inputs. This review examines the varied aspects of N in the soils and cropping systems as reflected by research at The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Syria in collaboration with other countries of the West Asia–North Africa region, especially in Morocco and other countries north and south of the Mediterranean. The synthesis, therefore, reflects a broad overview of conditions that impinge an N nutrition of crops and the evolution of N research achievements since the advent of commercial fertilization over three decades ago. With few exceptions, the soils of the Mediterranean region are low in organic matter and consequently in the reserves of total N, thus posing a limit of growing crops without fertilizer N or biological N fixation (BNF) through legumes. Soil calibration studies established the value of the soil nitrate test as a predictor of crop response with field trials to establish application rates for the main crops. Applicability is influenced by depth of sampling and the extent of mineralization. Dryland crop responses to N varied widely throughout the region from 30 to 150 kg N ha − 1 , being dependent on soil N status and seasonal rainfall as the major determinant of yields. Splitting the N application was only advantageous in higher rainfall areas. Residual N from BNF by food and forage legumes influenced soil N supply for cereals and relative responses to N fertilizer. The contribution of rhizobia fixation to all the major legumes was quantified using 15 N along with management factors that influenced BNF by legumes. Where legumes were newly introduced to a region, rhizobial inoculation was considered necessary. With cereal responses to fertilizer N, differences between varieties were highlighted. Where urea or ammonium–N fertilizers were used, volatilization was the main loss mechanisms rather than leaching or denitrification. Considerable work was done on N use within crop rotation systems and components of the N cycle defined along with inputs from urine and feces from grazing animals. Forage legumes were shown to enhance total soil N and both labile and biomass N, with the least influence from fallow. These N forms were shown to fluctuate during the year as moisture and temperature conditions changed. Fertilizer N use had a positive effect on grain quality with increased protein, as well as soil organic matter (SOM) and thus soil quality. The significant change of the gradual introduction of supplemental irrigation in traditional rainfed cropping areas and its implications for use of models to describe the complex nature of N in dryland cropping systems was described. With the likelihood of a continuation of intensification of the dryland cropping systems in the Mediterranean region, N fertilizer use will inevitably increase and along with it the need for greater use efficiency in the interest of production economics and the environment. While limited use has been made of modeling of N, this approach is likely to be of more significance in integrating the varied facets of N under Mediterranean cropping conditions.

TI  - A model of the physical protection of organic matter in soils
PY  - 1997
AB  - Current computer simulation models do not treat the physical protection of organic matter in soil mechanistically. A model is presented that describes physical protection explicitly as a function of the capacity of clay particles and aggregates to hold organic matter. The net rate of decomposition of organic matter depends not simply on soil texture but on the degree to which the protective capacity of the soil is already occupied. The rate at which organic matter becomes protected depends on both the amount of free organic matter and the degree to which the protective capacity is filled. The rate at which organic matter is released from protection depends only on the amount of protected organic matter. The model closely followed the buildup and decline of organic matter in 10 soils to which grass residues were added each year for a period of 10 yr and then left without addition for a further 10 yr. An estimate made with the model of the maximum capacity of each of these soils to protect organic matter was closely correlated with the clay fraction in the soils. With this model, we were better able to predict the buildup and decline in amounts of soil organic matter in soils of different textures and initial organic matter contents than with conventional, implicit descriptions of protection. Our model accounted for 80% of the variance in the experimental data compared with 77 and 75% using the other two models. Secondly and importantly, the capacity of soil to protect organic matter was found to be positively and well related with the clay content of the soil in our model, whereas similar relationships were not found between soil texture and the parameters controlling protection in the other models.

TI  - Controlling factors of sheet erosion under degraded grasslands in the sloping lands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2011
AB  - The current increase in the global demand for food and fresh water and the associated land use changes or misuses exacerbate water erosion which has become a major threat to the sustainability of the soil and water resources. Soil erosion by rainfall and runoff is a natural and geologic phenomenon, and one of the most important components of the global geochemical cycle. Despite numerous studies on crop lands, there is still a need to quantify soil sheet erosion (an erosion form that uniformly removes fertile upper soil horizons) under grasslands and to assess the factors of the environment that control its spatial variation. For that purpose, fifteen 1Â m2 micro-plots installed within a 23Â ha catchment under pasture in the sloping lands of KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) were monitored during the 2007-2008 rainy season to evaluate runoff (R) and sediment losses (SL). Soil losses computed from the 37 rainfall events with soil erosion averaged 6.45Â tonÂ ha-1Â year-1with values from 3 to 13Â tonÂ ha-1Â year-1. SL were significantly correlated with the proportion of soil surface coverage by the vegetation (PÂ

TI  - Soil carbon sequestration impacts on global climate change and food security.
PY  - 2004
AB  - :The carbon sink capacity of the world’s agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossilfuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.

TI  - Testing DNDC model for simulating soil respiration and assessing the effects of climate change on the CO2 gas flux from Irish agriculture
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Simulation models can be valuable to investigate potential effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. DNDC (the DeNitrification-DeComposition model) was tested against observed soil respiration data from adjacent pasture and arable fields in the Irish midlands. The arable field was converted from grassland approximately 50 years ago and managed since 2003 under two different tillage systems; conventional and reduced tillage. Both fields were located on the same soil type, classified as a free draining sandy loam soil derived from fluvial glacial gravels with low soil moisture holding capacity. Soil respiration measurements were made from January 2003 to August 2005. Three climate scenarios were investigated, a baseline of measured climatic data from a weather station at the field site, and high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios predicted by the Community Climate Change Consortium for Ireland (C4I) based on the Hadley Centre Global Climate Model (HadCM 3 ) and the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario. The aims of this study were to use measured soil respiration rates to validate the DNDC model for estimating CO 2 efflux from these key Irish soils, investigate the effects of future climate change on CO 2 efflux and estimate the efflux uncertainties due to using different future climate projections. The results indicate that the DNDC model can reliably estimate soil respiration from the two fields examined. The model underestimated annual measured CO 2 efflux from the pasture by only13% (model efficiency: ME = 0.6; root mean square error: RMSE = 1.9 and mean absolute error: MAE = 6.3) and that from the arable conventional and reduced tillage by 9% (ME = 0.6; RMSE = 1.6 and MAE = 2.4) and 8% (ME = 0.23; RMSE = 1.8 and MAE = 2.9), respectively. Short-term land use change had no significant effects on CO 2 effluxes from soil. Using the high temperature sensitivity scenario, future C effluxes would increase by 15% for the pasture and 14 and 16% for the arable conventional and reduced tillage systems, respectively. However, under the low temperature sensitivity scenario, lower increases in the C efflux of 6% for the pasture and 5% for the arable field were predicted. The calculated annual CO 2 efflux uncertainties for using the high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios were 9% for the pasture and 8% for the arable field.

TI  - The effects of temperature, water-filled pore space and land use on N2O emissions from an imperfectly drained gleysol
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary
To investigate the effect of soil physical conditions and land use on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere, soil cores of an imperfectly drained gleysol were taken from adjacent fields under perennial ryegrass and winter wheat. The cores were fertilized with ammonium nitrate and incubated at three different temperatures and water-filled pore space (WFPS) values, and N2O emissions were measured by gas chromatography. Emissions showed a very large response to temperature. Apparent values of Q10 (emission rate at (T + 10)°C/emission rate at T°C) for the arable soil were about 50 for the 5–12°C interval and 8.9 for 12–18°C; the corresponding Q10s for the grassland soil were 3.7 and 2.3. Emissions from the grassland soil were always greater than those from the arable soil, although the ratio narrowed with increasing temperature. Changes in soil WFPS also had a profound effect on emissions. Those from the arable soil increased about 30-fold as the WFPS increased from 60 to 80%, while that from the grassland soil increased 12-fold. This latter response was similar to earlier field measurements. The N2O emissions were considered to be produced primarily by denitrification. We concluded that the impacts of temperature and WFPS on emissions could both be explained on the basis of existing models relating increasing respiration or decreased oxygen diffusivity, or both, to the development of anaerobic zones within the soil.

TI  - Soil and vegetable crop response to addition of different levels of municipal waste compost under Mediterranean greenhouse conditions
PY  - 2010
AB  - In the soil thematic strategy of the European Union Commission, a soil organic carbon content of 2% is indicated as a threshold below which a reduction in soil chemical, biological and physical fertility, and increase in erosion can be observed. Composting of organic matter ‘exogenous’ to soil (such as from municipalities, industries and agriculture sources) is recommended as an effective way to ensure the return of biomass to soil and the return of the soil organic matter losses. The composting of municipal solid wastes is seen as a strategy to divert organic waste materials from landfills. A municipal source-separated solid waste compost was used in a study carried out during 2003–2006 in Southern Italy. An annual tomato-snap bean-lettuce rotation was planted on a sandy loam soil with 26 g kg−1 organic carbon under greenhouse conditions. Different rates of compost (15-30-45 tha−1 on a dry weight basis) and combinations of compost at a rate of 15 t ha−1 with reduced doses of mineral N fertilizer (1/2 or 1/4 of optimal supply) were compared with an untreated control and a N, P, K fertilized control. We found that: (1) increasing compost rates produced increasing positive soil organic carbon balances. The C conversion efficiency was 23 and 36% with 15 and 30 t ha−1, respectively, but declined to 28% with the highest rate of compost. Indeed, the higher the compost amounts applied, the higher the soil organic carbon losses. (2) Under tunnel-greenhouse conditions, all the fertilization strategies, except compost at a rate of 15 t ha−1, increased soil nitrate concentrations by up 100 to 400 mg kg−1 dry weight of soil, particularly in the spring-summer seasons. In the same period, nitrate contents in the untreated control reached 100 mg kg−1. (3) The average yield of marketable tomato for the four-year period was 114 t ha−1 and did not vary significantly among treatments. No differences in snap bean yields were detected among the fertilization treatments. In lettuce cultivation, however, 30 and 45 t ha−1 of compost yielded more than other treatments. In the tunnel-greenhouse environment, a high initial content of soil organic matter resulted in high vegetable yields over all four years, even without mineral or organic fertilizer supply. However, among the various fertilization strategies, the best solution able to restore annual soil carbon mineralization was the supply of 15 t ha−1 of compost. In addition, this rate reduced the hazards linked to the high release of nitrates in soil caused by 30 and 45 t ha−1 rates of compost or mineral fertilization.

TI  - Do combined applications of crop residues and inorganic fertilizer lower emission of N2O from soil
PY  - 2010
AB  - Emissions of N 2 O were measured following addition of 15 N-labelled residues of tropical plant species [Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna pruriens and Leucaena leucocephala] to a Ferric Luvisol from Ghana at a rate of 100 mg N/kg soil under controlled environment conditions. Residues were also applied in different ratio combinations with inorganic N fertilizer, at a total rate of 100 mg N/kg soil. N 2 0 emissions were increased after addition of residues, and further increased with combined (ratio) applications of residues and inorganic N fertilizer. However, 15 N-N 2 O production was low and short-lived in all treatments, suggesting that most of the measured N 2 O-N was derived from the applied fertilizer or native soil mineral N pools. There was no consistent trend in magnitude of emissions with increasing proportion of inorganic fertilizer in the application. The positive interactive effect between residue- and fertilizer-N sources was most pronounced in the 25:75 Leucaena:fertilizer and cowpea:fertilizer treatments where 1082 and 1130 mg N 2 O-N/g residue were emitted over 30 days. N 2 O (log e ) emission from all residue amended treatments was positively correlated with the residue C:N ratio, and negatively correlated with residue polyphenol content, polyphenol:N ratio and (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio, indicating the role of residue chemical composition in regulating emissions even when combined with inorganic fertilizer. The positive interactive effect in our treatments suggests that it is unlikely that combined applications of residues and inorganic fertilizer can lower N 2 0 emissions unless the residue is of very low quality promoting strong immobilisation of soil mineral N.

TI  - Crushed cotton gin compost effects on soil biological properties, nutrient leaching losses, and maize yield
PY  - 2006
AB  - There is currently interest in the use of industrial by-products to reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers; however, most organic wastes contain relatively low N levels. Our objectives were to: (i) determine the effect of incorporating crushed cotton gin compost, with and without inorganic fertilizers, on soil biological properties during three maize crops (Zea mays L., cv. Tundra); (ii) study nutrient leaching losses from soils receiving these fertilizer treatments; and (iii) to evaluate the effect of these fertilizer treatments on nutrition and yield of a maize crop. Compost was applied at 0, 20, and 40 t ha -1 rates with and without 400 kg N ha -1 (as NH 4 NO 3 ), 80 kg P ha -1 [as (NH 4 )H 2 PO 4 ], and 120 kg K ha -1 (as K 2 SO 4 ) on a Typic Xerofluvent located near Sevilla (Andalusia, Spain) for 3 yr. At the end of the study, soil microbial biomass was 32% higher in the treatment including inorganic fertilizer than in the compost-only treatment. Soil biochemical properties were greater in the fertilizer treatment than the compost-only treatment (by 61, 50, 36, and 32% for dehydrogenase, N-a-benzoyl-L-argininamide protease, arylsulfatase, and phosphatase activities). Macronutrient losses were greatest iii the treatment including inorganic fertilizer, where increases of 24% for inorganic N, 31% for P, and 18.5% for K over the compost treatment were noted. Lowest N/P ratios were produced by the treatment including inorganic fertilizer, which suggest a lower eutrophication risk in drainage waters from soils treated with this fertilizer. The mineral nutrition, grain protein, and maize yield indicate that the compost plus inorganic fertilizer is adequate and has a good potential for use.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes in varying soils types under conventional and no-tillage practices.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Consideration of the environmental effects of the no-tillage practice should be made on the basis of its effects on both carbon and nitrogen cycles. There is a lack of data on the effects of the no-till management in the cool and humid climate and typical soil types of Northern Europe. We measured the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) on conventionally ploughed agricultural soils and on respective soils that had been under no-till practice for 5–7 years. Ten chamber measurement investigations were carried out during a 10-month period on six pairs of tilled and no-till fields on clayey (Vertic Cambisols, three pairs), coarse (Eutric Regosols, two pairs), and organic (Dystric Histosols, one pair) soils located between latitudes 60° and 62° N. The results suggest that there is a risk of increased N2O emissions in the first years of no-till practice under small grain spring cereal cultivation in Northern European boreal climate. Carbon dioxide emissions measured as total ecosystem respiration were either unchanged, increased or decreased under no-till. Fluxes of CH4 were negligible and not affected by no-till practice. Dry bulk density and soil moisture were higher in no-till soils compared to annually mouldboard ploughed soils. Variation in the greenhouse gas fluxes was best explained by the content of carbon and nitrogen in the topsoil of 0–20 cm.

TI  - Energy requirements for transport and surface application of liquid pig manure in Manitoba, Canada
PY  - 2008
AB  - The objective of this study was to conduct a thorough accounting of energy used to transport liquid pig manure from farm storage to the field and to surface-apply the manure. Energy consumption was determined using both energy data from the literature plus data from field-scale research. Energy consumption was compared between two manure application systems (the drag hose and the slurry wagon systems) and two application timing treatments (single vs. twice-annual manure application). The single annual application of liquid pig manure applied at 81.5 m3 ha-1 and transported 1.8 km from storage to field consumed 2180 mJ ha-1 with the drag hose system and 2185 mJ ha-1 with the slurry wagon system. The twice-annual manure application regime used 2726 and 2209 mJ ha-1 for the drag hose and slurry wagon systems, respectively. When energy use was calculated on the basis of MJ per kg of available N, liquid pig manure applied once annually with the slurry wagon system provided N at 17.76 mJ kg-1 of available N, which was 33% of the energy cost of N from anhydrous ammonia and 23% of the energy cost of N from urea. Manure transport distance could be increased to 8.4 km before the energy cost per kg of available N from pig manure was equivalent to anhydrous ammonia, and up to 12.3 km before the energy cost of manure N was equivalent to urea N. Despite the high energy cost to deliver liquid pig manure from storage to field, the much lower cost per kg of available N compared to inorganic fertilizer N highlights the opportunities that exist for improving the energy efficiency of industrial agriculture by replacing inorganic fertilizers with manure.

TI  - Soil Surface Fluxes of Greenhouse Gases in an Irrigated Maize-Based Agroecosystem
PY  - 2005
AB  - An understanding of the effect of fertility management on soil surface fluxes of CO 2 , N 2 O, and CH 4 is essential in evaluating C sequestration measures that attempt to increase the amount of crop residue returned to the soil through increased fertilizer inputs. In this sludy, soil surface CO 2 flux was measured over a 27-mo sampling period in continuous maize (Zea mays L.) plots managed under either an intensive fertility regime (M2) or recommended best management (M1). Flux was significantly higher in the M2 treatment on only 2 d during the first growing season. Annual estimates of soil surface CO 2 flux, based on a modified exponential equation that incorporates leaf area index (LAI) to predict temporal changes in soil respiration, averaged 11550 kg C ha -1 yr -1 for both treatments (approximately 31.64 kg C ha -1 d -1 on average). Within row soil surface CO 2 flux was, on average, 64% higher than between row flux. Plant population did not significantly affect measured soil surface CO 2 flux. While fertility management had no significant effect on CH 4 flux, N 2 O flux as measured on 3 d during the 2000 growing season was significantly higher in the M2 treatment. In 2001, no significant differences in N 2 O flux were observed, possibly due to changes in N management and irrigation method. Electrical conductivity measured during the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons was significantly higher in the M2 treatment while pH measured during the 2001 season was significantly lower for M2.

TI  - The environmental consequences of adopting conservation tillage in Europe: reviewing the evidence
PY  - 2004
AB  - Conservation tillage (CT) is practised on 45 million ha world-wide, predominantly in North and South America but its uptake is also increasing in South Africa, Australia and other semi-arid areas of the world. It is primarily used as a means to protect soils from erosion and compaction, to conserve moisture and reduce production costs. In Europe, the area cultivated using minimum tillage is increasing primarily in an effort to reduce production costs, but also as a way of preventing soil erosion and retain soil moisture. A large proportion (16%) of Europe’s cultivated land is also prone to soil degradation but farmers and governments are being slow to recognise and address the problem, despite the widespread environmental problems that can occur when soils become degraded. Conservation tillage can improve soil structure and stability thereby facilitating better drainage and water holding capacity that reduces the extremes of water logging and drought. These improvements to soil structure also reduce the risk of runoff and pollution of surface waters with sediment, pesticides and nutrients. Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation lowers energy consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide, while carbon sequestration is raised though the increase in soil organic matter (SOM). Under conservation tillage, a richer soil biota develops that can improve nutrient recycling and this may also help combat crop pests and diseases. The greater availability of crop residues and weed seeds improves food supplies for insects, birds and small mammals. All these aspects are reviewed but detailed information on the environmental benefits of conservation tillage is sparse and disparate from European studies. No detailed studies have been conducted at the catchment scale in Europe, therefore some findings must be treated with caution until they can be verified at a larger scale and for a greater range of climatic, cropping and soil conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-term tillage and crop residue management in the subarctic: fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide
PY  - 1997
AB  - Methane and nitrous oxide are important radiatively active gases that are influenced by agricultural practices. This study assesses long-term tillage, crop residue management, and N fertilization rates on the flux of these two gases at a high latitude site representing the northern fringe of large-scale agriculture. Cumulative methane uptake for the summer was higher from no-tillage plots than tilled plots. This was associated with lower soil water contents with tillage. Thus, the reduction in CH4 uptake was attributed to water stress on methane oxidizers. At planting, soil water contents were near field capacity, and the no-till plots had the lowest uptake which was attributed to restricted diffusion of methane to active sites. A similar pattern of methane uptake to soil water content was found with the residue management treatments. Removing the straw lowered the soil water content and for most of the season methane uptake was also lower than where the straw had been left on the plots. Nitrogen fertiliz...

TI  - Can biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) genes from perennial Leymus racemosus (Triticeae) combat nitrification in wheat farming
PY  - 2007
AB  - Using a recombinant luminescent Nitrosomonas europaea assay to quantify biological nitrification inhibition (BNI), we found that a wild relative of wheat (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tzvelev) had a high BNI capacity and releases about 20 times more BNI compounds (about 30 ATU g−1 root dry weight 24 h−1) than Triticum aestivum L. (cultivated wheat). The root exudate from cultivated wheat has no inhibitory effect on nitrification when applied to soil; however, the root exudate from L. racemous suppressed \( {\text{NO}}^{ - }_{3} \) formation and kept more than 90% of the soil’s inorganic-N in the \( {\text{NH}}^{ + }_{4} \)-form for 60 days. The high-BNI capacity of L. racemosus is mostly associated with chromosome Lr#n. Two other chromosomes Lr#J, and Lr#I also have an influence on BNI production. Tolerance of L. racemosus to \( {\text{NH}}^{ + }_{4} \) is controlled by chromosome 7Lr#1-1. Sustained release of BNI compounds occurred only in the presence of \( {\text{NH}}^{ + }_{4} \) in the root environment. Given the level of BNI production expressed in DALr#n and assuming normal plant growth, we estimated that nearly 87,500,000 ATU of BNI activity ha−1 day−1 could be released in a field of vigorously growing wheat; this amounts to the equivalent of the inhibitory effect from the application of 52.5 g of the synthetic nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (one AT unit of BNI activity is equivalent to 0.6 μg of nitrapyrin). At this rate of BNI production it would take only 19 days for a BNI-enabled wheat crop to produce the inhibitory power of a standard commercial application of nitrapyrin, 1 kg ha−1. The synthetic nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide, blocked specifically the AMO (ammonia monooxygenase) pathway, while the BNI from L. racemosus blocked the HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase) pathway in Nitrosomonas. Here we report the first finding of high production of BNI in a wild relative of any cereal and its successful introduction and expression in cultivated wheat. These results demonstrate the potential for empowering the new generation of wheat cultivars with high-BNI capacity to control nitrification in wheat-production systems.

TI  - Climate change and grasslands through the ages: an overview
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary

Change from cool to warm temperatures and vice versa have occurred throughout geological time. During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (206–65 million years ago, Ma) the climate was more uniformly warm and moist than at present and tropical rainforests were widespread. Grasses evolved during the Jurassic period and they expanded greatly as the climate differentiated with reduced rainfall and temperatures. C4-grasses probably arose during the Oligocene period (24–35 Ma). During the Miocene period (23·8–5·3 Ma) grasslands expanded into huge areas (e.g. prairies in the USA, steppe in Eurasia, and pampas and llanos in South America). During the Quaternary period (1·8 Ma till now) some twenty-two different ice ages with periodicities of about 100 000 years occurred. Eighteen-thousand years ago, north-western Europe had a polar climate with tundra vegetation and the Mediterranean region was covered by steppe. During that time Amazonia was so dry that it was covered in extensive areas of savanna and the Sahara expanded rapidly. Only in the last 10 000 years has a closed rainforest covered the Amazonian region again. However, 9000 years ago a brief period of global warming caused excessive rains, which caused the sea and river levels to rise in north-western Europe with tremendous loss of life. The present period of extreme dryness in the Sahara only started some 5000 years ago and then the desert expanded rapidly into the Sahel. Before that the Sahara was covered by steppe. Global warming took place between about ad 900 and about ad 1200 or 1300 just before the Little Ice Age (1550–1700 ad). The article concludes with a description of temperature and vegetation changes that are occurring in Europe at present. It is predicted that C4-grasses, which are already present in southern Europe, will further expand but that, in the short term, land abandonment will have much more deleterious effects than temperature change due to increased wild fires, loss of biodiversity and desertification.

TI  - Land Use and Management Practices Impact on Plant Biomass Carbon and Soil Carbon Dioxide Emission
PY  - 2010
AB  - Land use and management practices may influence plant C inputs and soil CO 2 emission. We evaluated the effect of a combination of irrigation, tillage, cropping system, and N fertilization on plant biomass C, soil temperature and water content at the 0- to 15-cm depth, and CO 2 emission in a sandy loam soil from April to October, 2006 to 2008, in western North Dakota. Treatments were two irrigation practices (irrigated and unirrigated) and six cropping systems (conventional-tilled malt barley [Hordeum vulgare L.] with N fertilizer [CTBFN], conventional-tilled malt barley with no N fertilizer [CTBON], no-tilled malt barley-pea [Pisum sativum L.] with N fertilizer [NTB-PN], no-tilled malt barley with N fertilizer [NTBFN], no-tilled malt barley with no N fertilizer [NTBON], and no-tilled Conservation Reserve Program [NTCRP]). Plant biomass C was greater in NTBFN than in NTBON in 2006 and 2007 but was greater in NTB-PN than in CTBON, NTBON, or NTCRP in 2008. Soil temperature was greater but water content was lower in NTCRP than in CTBFN and NTBFN. Soil CO 2 flux peaked immediately following heavy rain or irrigation (> 15 mm). Total CO 2 ftux from April to October was greater in the irrigated than in the unirrigated practice and greater in NTCRP than in annual cropping systems. Soil CO 2 emission was probably related more to soil temperature and water content or tillage than to aboveground plant C input. Because of reduced CO 2 flux compared with CTBON and NTCRP but similar biomass yield as NTBFN and CTBFN, NTB-PN may be used to reduce CO 2 emission from croplands in the northern Great Plains.

TI  - A high-throughput method for the quantification of proanthocyanidins in forage crops and its application in assessing variation in condensed tannin content in breeding programmes for Lotus corniculatus and Lotus uliginosus.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Lotus corniculatus and Lotus uliginosus are agronomically important forage crops used in ruminant livestock production. The condensed tannin (CT) content, dry matter (DM) production, and persistence of these species are key characteristics of interest for future exploitation of these crops. Here we present field data on 19 varieties of L. corniculatus, 2 varieties of L. uliginosus and, additionally, a glasshouse experiment using 6 varieties of L. corniculatus and 2 varieties of L. uliginosus. Current methods for the quantification of condensed tannins in crop species are slow and labor intensive and are generally based upon polymer hydrolysis following the extraction of chlorophyll in a liquid phase. Presented here is a high-throughput protocol for condensed tannin quantification suitable for microtiter plates based upon the precipitation of condensed tannin polymers in complex with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with subsequent hydrolysis of precipates using butan 1-ol/ hydrochloric acid.

TI  - Assessing the ecological soundness of organic and conventional agriculture by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) - a case study of leek production
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose



– Sustainable agriculture implies the ability of agro‐ecosystems to remain productive in the long‐term. It is not easy to point out unambiguously whether or not current production systems meet this sustainability demand. A priori thinking would suggest that organic crops are environmentally favourable, but may ignore the effect of reduced productivity, which shifts the potential impact to other parts of the food provision system. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ecological sustainability of conventional and organic leek production by means of life cycle assessment (LCA).




Design/methodology/approach



– A cradle‐to‐farm gate LCA is applied, based on real farm data from two research centres. For a consistent comparison, two functional units (FU) were defined: 1ha and 1 kg of leek production.




Findings



– Assessed on an area basis, organic farming shows a more favourable environmental profile. These overall benefits are strongly reduced when the lower yields are taken into account. Related to organic farming it is therefore important that solutions are found to substantially increase the yields without increasing the environmental burden. Related to conventional farming, important potential for environmental improvements are in optimising the farm nutrient flows, reducing pesticide use and increasing its self‐supporting capacity.




Research limitations/implications



– The research is a cradle‐to‐farm gate LCA, future research can be expanded to comprise all phases from cradle‐to‐grave to get an idea of the total sustainability of our present food consumption patterns. The research is also limited to the case of leek production. Future research can apply the methodology to other crops.




Originality/value



– To date, there is still lack of clear evidence of the added value of organic farming compared to conventional farming on environmental basis. Few studies have compared organic and conventional food production by means of LCA. This paper addresses these issues.

TI  - The Impact of Nitrogen Placement and Tillage on NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 Fluxes from a Clay Loam Soil
PY  - 2006
AB  - To evaluate the impact of N placement depth and no-till (NT) practice on the emissions of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 from soils, we conducted two N placement experiments in a long-term tillage experiment site in northeastern Colorado in 2004. Trace gas flux measurements were made 2–3 times per week, in zero-N fertilizer plots that were cropped continuously to corn (Zea mays L.) under conventional-till (CT) and NT. Three N placement depths, replicated four times (5, 10 and 15 cm in Exp. 1 and 0, 5 and 10 cm in Exp. 2, respectively) were used. Liquid urea–ammonium nitrate (UAN, 224 kg N ha−1) was injected to the desired depth in the CT- or NT-soils in each experiment. Mean flux rates of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 μg N m−2 h−1, 60.5 to 92.4 μg N m−2 h−1, −0.8 to 0.5 μg C m−2 h−1, and 42.1 to 81.7 mg C m−2 h−1 in both experiments, respectively. Deep N placement (10 and 15 cm) resulted in lower NO and N2O emissions compared with shallow N placement (0 and 5 cm) while CH4 and CO2 emissions were not affected by N placement in either experiment. Compared with N placement at 5 cm, for instance, averaged N2O emissions from N placement at 10 cm were reduced by more than 50% in both experiments. Generally, NT decreased NO emission and CH4 oxidation but increased N2O emissions compared with CT irrespective of N placement depths. Total net global warming potential (GWP) for N2O, CH4 and CO2 was reduced by deep N placement only in Exp. 1 but was increased by NT in both experiments. The study results suggest that deep N placement (e.g., 10 cm) will be an effective option for reducing N oxide emissions and GWP from both fertilized CT- and NT-soils.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes following tillage from a mollisol in the Argentine Rolling Pampa
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Carbon dioxide emission from soil plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Short term losses of soil carbon due to tillage are of a variable magnitude. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of plowing the soil on CO2-C emissions during summer in a coarse-loamy mixed thermic Typic Hapludoll from the Argentine Rolling Pampa. Temperature after tillage was higher in the plowed soil than under no-tillage, being higher the soil water content in the later treatment. Plowing the soil did not produce an immediately impact on soil surface CO2-C emission, but induced an important CO2-C flush few days later. A difference of 16 up to 25 kg C ha–1 d–1 in the CO2-C emissions was observed from the second up to the fourth sampling dates after tillage. Difference in total CO2-C emissions between the plowed soil and the no-tillage treatment was 580 kg C ha–1, during the 40 days measurement period. This difference in CO2-C emission was partitioned between residue decomposition and humus mineralization. Carbon mineralized from humus was 270 kg C ha–1 higher under plow tillage than under no tillage. This figure represented an important extra loss of 0.48% of the soil organic carbon content from the 0–30 cm depth, as consequence of plowing in the warmest season of the year.

TI  - Transitioning from standard to minimum tillage: Trade-offs between soil organic matter stabilization, nitrous oxide emissions, and N availability in irrigated cropping systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Few studies address nutrient cycling during the transition period (e.g., 1–4 years following conversion) from standard to some form of conservation tillage. This study compares the influence of minimum versus standard tillage on changes in soil nitrogen (N) stabilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, shortterm N cycling, and crop N use efficiency 1 year after tillage conversion in conventional (i.e., synthetic fertilizer-N only), low-input (i.e., alternating annual synthetic fertilizer- and cover crop-N), and organic (i.e., manure- and cover crop-N) irrigated, maize–tomato systems in California. To understand the mechanisms governing N cycling in these systems, we traced 15 N-labeled fertilizer/cover crop into the maize grain, whole soil, and three soil fractions: macroaggregates (>250 mm), microaggregates (53– 250 mm) and silt-and-clay (<53 mm). We found a cropping system effect on soil Nnew (i.e., N derived from 15 N-fertilizer or - 15 N-cover crop), with 173 kg Nnew ha � 1 in the conventional system compared to 71.6 and 69.2 kg Nnew ha � 1 in the low-input and organic systems, respectively. In the conventional system, more Nnew was found in the microaggregate and silt-and-clay fractions, whereas, the Nnew of the organic and low-input systems resided mainly in the macroaggregates. Even though no effect of tillage was found on soil aggregation, the minimum tillage systems showed greater soil fraction-Nnew than the standard tillage systems, suggesting greater potential for N stabilization under minimum tillage. GrainNnew was also higher in the minimum versus standard tillage systems. Nevertheless, minimum tillage led to the greatest N2O emissions (39.5 g N2O–N ha � 1 day � 1 ) from the conventional cropping system, where N turnover was already the fastest among the cropping systems. In contrast, minimum tillage combined with the low-input system (which received the least N ha � 1 ) produced intermediate N2O emissions, soil N stabilization, and crop N use efficiency. Although total soil N did not change after 1 year of conversion from standard to minimum tillage, our use of stable isotopes permitted the early detection of interactive effects between tillage regimes and cropping systems that determine the trade-offs among N stabilization, N2O emissions, and N availability.

TI  - Non‐inversion tillage and farmland birds: a review with special reference to the UK and Europe
PY  - 2004
AB  - This paper reviews the current knowledge of the effects of non-inversion tillage (NIT) on farmland birds and their food resources. NIT is a method of establishing a crop without using a mouldboard plough and is becoming increasingly popular in the UK. NIT generally disturbs the soil to shallower depths than conventional tillage and is therefore expected to have beneficial effects on biodiversity on arable land as compared with mouldboard ploughing. The diets of farmland birds change throughout the year, and many species take invertebrates over the breeding season. Seeds are also important for many species of farmland birds throughout the year and especially over the winter months. The effects of NIT on these farmland bird food resources, in particular ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), spiders (Arachnida: Araneae), earthworms (Annelida) and seeds (arable weeds and cereal crops) are reviewed.

TI  - Storage and sequestration potential of topsoil organic carbon in China's paddy soils
PY  - 2003
AB  - Carbon (C) storage and sequestration in agricultural soils is considered to be an important issue in the study of terrestrial C cycling and global climatic change. The baseline C stock and the C sequestration potential are among the criteria for a region or a state to adopt strategies or policies in response to commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. Paddy soils represent a large portion of global cropland. However, little information on the potential of C sequestration and storage is available for such soils. In this paper, an estimation of the topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and the sequestration potential of paddy soils in China was made by using the data from the 2nd State Soil Survey carried out during 1979–1982 and from the nationwide arable soil monitoring system established since then. Results showed that the SOC density ranged from 12 to 226 t C ha � 1 with an area-weighted mean density of 44 t C ha � 1 , which is comparable to that of the US grasslands and is higher than that of the cultivated dryland soils in China and the US. The estimated total topsoil SOC pool is 1.3 Pg, with 0.85 Pg from the upper plow layer and 0.45 Pg from the plowpan layer. This pool size is � 2% of China’s total storage in the top 1 m of the soil profiles and � 4% of the total topsoil pool, while the area percentage of paddy soil is 3.4% of the total land. The C pool in paddy soils was found predominantly in southeast China geographically and in the subgroups of Feaccumulating and Fe-leaching paddy soils pedogenetically. In comparison with dryland cultivation, irrigation-based rice cultivation in China has induced significant enrichment of SOC storage (0.3 Pg) in paddy soils. The induced total C sequestration equals half of China’s total annual CO2 emission in the 1990s. Estimates using different SOC sequestration scenarios show that the paddy soils of China have an easily attainable SOC sequestration potential of 0.7 Pg under present conditions and may ultimately sequester 3.0 Pg. Soil monitoring data showed that the current C sequestration rate is 12 Tg yr � 1 . The total C sequestration potential and the current sequestration rate of the paddy soils are over 30%, while the area of the paddy soils is 26% that of China’s total croplands. Therefore, practicing sustainable agriculture is urgently needed for enhancing SOC storage to realize the ultimate SOC sequestration of rice-based agriculture of China, as the current C sequestration rate is significantly lower than the potential rate.

TI  - Effects of manure and cultivation on carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions from a corn field under Mediterranean conditions.
PY  - 2010
AB  - The use of organic residues as soil additives is increasing, but, depending on their composition and application methods, these organic amendments can stimulate the emissions of CO(2) and N(2)O. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of management practices in irrigated sweet corn (Zea mays L.) on CO(2) and N(2)O emissions and to relate emissions to environmental factors. In a 3-yr study, corn residues (CR) and pasteurized chicken manure (PCM) were used as soil amendments compared with no residue (NR) under three management practices: shallow tillage (ST) and no tillage (NT) under consecutive corn crops and ST without crop. Tillage significantly increased (P < 0.05) CO(2) and N(2)O fluxes in residue-amended plots and in NR plots. Carbon dioxide and N(2)O fluxes were correlated with soil NH(4) concentrations and with days since tillage and days since seeding. Fluxes of CO(2) were correlated with soil water content, whereas N(2)O fluxes had higher correlation with air temperature. Annual CO(2) emissions were higher with PCM than with CR and NR (9.7, 2.9, and 2.3 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). Fluxes of N(2)O were 34.4, 0.94, and 0.77 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) with PCM, CR, and NR, respectively. Annual amounts of CO(2)-C and N(2)O-N emissions from the PCM treatments were 64 and 3% of the applied C and N, respectively. Regardless of cultivation practices, elevated N(2)O emissions were recorded in the PCM treatment. These emissions could negate some of the beneficial effects of PCM on soil properties.

TI  - Residual effect of organic carbon as a tool for mitigating nitrogen oxides emissions in semi-arid climate
PY  - 2009
AB  - Residual effects of different fertilizers (mineral and organic) on the first pulses of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) after rewetting dry soil with or without application of a mineral N fertilizer were studied in a laboratory experiment. Six months before this study was conducted the fields had received either manure + urea, manure, urea or no fertilizer. In the first phase the soil was rewetted with water simulating a summer shower (heavy rainfall in short time) and in the second phase with a urea solution simulating a mineral fertilization. There were not significant differences in trace gas emissions between earlier field treatments after soil was rewetted with water addition. However, after urea addition, plots that had received manure 6 months earlier showed smaller total emissions of N2O and NO compared to plots that had only received urea. The residual effect of manure can play an important role in carbon poor soils under arid-semiarid climate in mitigating atmospheric pollutants such us NO and N2O.

TI  - TILLAGE AND RESIDUE EFFECTS ON RUNOFF AND EROSION DYNAMICS
PY  - 2004
AB  - The carry-over effects from one year to the next of surface residue and tillage management decisions on runoff
and erosion are not clear. The dynamics of runoff and erosion processes during rainfall events are likely dependent on the
tillage and residue management system. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of tillage practices and residue
management, by removal of residue cover, on the properties that describe the dynamics of the runoff and erosion processes.
Six-row, 12.2 m long . 5.5 m wide, plots under conventional tillage (CT) or no tillage (NT) corn (Zea mays L.) for nine years
were used in this study. Plots had an average slope of 5.7% on a Grenada silt loam (Glossic Fragiudalf) soil. Rainfall
simulations were conducted on a 10.7 m . 3.7 m area within each plot at a rate of 65 mm h -1 for 1 h under natural antecedent
soil-water conditions (dry run), followed by a 0.5 h simulation 4 h later (wet run), and another 0.5 h application 30 min later
(very wet run). The ten treatments consisted of an incomplete 2 . 2 . 3 factorial arrangement of two tillage histories (CTh
and NTh), two tillage levels (tilled and not tilled), and three residue management levels (residue left, residue removed just
prior to simulated rainfall, and residue removed one year prior to simulated rainfall). The missing treatments were the
NTh-tilled and CTh-not tilled with residue left. The time of runoff initiation, maximum runoff rate, flow velocity, and
maximum sediment concentration were used to describe differences in runoff and erosion dynamics. Residue removal resulted
in significantly sooner runoff with the NT system. There was a significant carry-over effect of residue removal with runoff
initiated 35% sooner the subsequent year of removal and sediment concentrations increasing by >100%. Maximum sediment
concentrations were lower for the CTh land that was not tilled than for the tilled despite the untilled land experiencing sooner
runoff and higher runoff rates. Tilling NTh land resulted in significantly lower sediment concentrations than tilling CTh land,
suggesting that the soil quality of NT was not immediately lost when tilled, but these beneficial properties were fully lost within
one year of residue removal.

TI  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Seine river and basin: observations and budgets.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract In the Seine basin (71 730 km 2 ) intensive use of N fertilizers in agriculture and the release of reduced N in urban wastewater, not fully eliminated in treatment plants, have deeply perturbed the regional nitrogen cycle, namely by promoting intense nitrification and denitrification, two key microbial processes involved in N 2 O emission. Sampling surveys in the whole Seine drainage network have shown that N 2 O water concentrations are always far above saturation with respect to atmospheric concentrations. Highest values are found in 1st order streams (1–4 μg N l −1 ), decrease by out-gazing down to 4th order rivers (0.5 μg N l −1 ) and increase again in polluted higher order rivers (4 μg N l −1 ). Calculated values of gas transfer velocities and the observed N 2 O supersaturation by stream order was used to estimate N 2 O emissions for the whole water surface area of the Seine drainage network to 100–200 × 10 3  kg N-N 2 O yr −1 . The results show that a major fraction of the emission occurs in head-water streams. On the basis of previous work, the emission by wastewater treatment plants – WWTPs – has been estimated at the scale of the Seine basin, to 150–260 × 10 3  kg N-N 2 O yr −1 , i.e. to be in the same range as N 2 O emissions from the entire water surface. Using an emission factor approach, based on an intensive literature survey considering grassland, cropland and forest soils distribution, the total direct emissions of N 2 O of the Seine basin was estimated to 10 400 × 10 3  kg N-N 2 O yr −1 among which 2500 × 10 3  kg N-N 2 O yr −1 are issued from the forested soils and 7900 × 10 3  kg N-N 2 O yr −1 from agricultural land. The latter figure agrees well with the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2006. AFOLU, N 2 O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO 2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application, vol. 4, 54 pp (Chapter 11)] estimate of 8250 × 10 3  kg N-N 2 O yr −1 . The quantified indirect emissions (from the river-atmosphere interface and from the WWTPs) thus represent 3–6% of the direct agricultural emissions of the Seine basin. However, N 2 O indirect emissions from ‘riparian zones’ have only been roughly calculated and, thus, are remaining uncertain. A conservative estimate might increase the indirect emissions to about 13–17% of the direct ones.

TI  - Effects of climate and management intensity on nitrous oxide emissions in grassland systems across Europe
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Soil/atmosphere exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide were monitored for a 3-year period at 10 grassland sites in eight European countries (Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom), spanning a wide range of climatic, environmental and soil conditions. Most study sites investigated the influence of one or several management practices on N2O exchange, such as nitrogen fertilization and grazing intensity. Fluxes were measured using non-steady state chambers at most sites, and alternative measurement techniques such as eddy covariance and fast-box using tunable diode laser spectroscopy were implemented at some sites. The overall uncertainty in annual flux estimates derived from chamber measurements may be as high as 50% due to the temporal and spatial variability in fluxes, which warrants the future use of continuous measurements, if possible at the field scale. Annual emission rates were higher from intensive than from extensive grasslands, by a factor 4 if grazed (1.77 versus 0.48 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) and by a factor 3 if ungrazed (0.95 versus 0.32 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Annual emission factors for fertilized systems were highly variable, ranging from 0.01% to 3.56%, but the mean emission factor across all sites (0.75%) was substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1.25%. Emission factors for individual fertilization events increased with soil temperature and were generally higher for water-filled pore space values in the range 60–90%, though precipitation onto dry soils was also shown to lead to high losses of N2O-N from applied fertilizer. An empirical, multiple regression model to predict N2O emission factors on the basis of soil temperature, moisture and rainfall is developed, explaining half of the variability in observed emission factors.

TI  - Global environmental impacts of agricultural expansion: The need for sustainable and efficient practices
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract
The recent intensification of agriculture, and the prospects of future intensification, will have major detrimental impacts on the nonagricultural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the world. The doubling of agricultural food production during the past 35 years was associated with a 6.87-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization, a 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in the amount of irrigated cropland, and a 1.1-fold increase in land in cultivation. Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.

TI  - Denitrification from an irrigated soil fertilized with pig slurry under Mediterranean conditions
PY  - 2004
AB  - Under a Mediterranean climate, denitrification losses were quantified for 2 years on a sandy loam soil with an irrigated maize crop. The effect of pig slurry application at two different rates (165 and 495 kg N ha−1, respectively, for PS1 and PS3) was compared with that of urea (U) applied at 165 kg N ha−1 and with a control treatment (P0) without fertilizer. After application, the denitrification rate (DR) increased in PS1 and PS3 respect to P0 and decreased to the levels of the control treatment after 5 days. In July and August (the irrigation period) the DR increased considerably in all treatments with maximum values for the PS3 treatment (0.134 g N m−2 day−1 in the first year and 0.147 g N m−2 day−1 in the second year). The differences in DRs between each treatment could be explained by the pattern of water filled pore space, NO3− concentration of the soil solution and the soil temperature during the maize growing season. In the first year denitrification losses in the 0–10 cm layer were 1.90, 2.49, 2.87 and 4.00 g N m−2 for P0, U, PS1 and PS3, respectively, while in the second year the losses were 1.21, 2.28, 2.47 and 3.42 g N m−2. Finally, a simple predictive model (SOILN) was evaluated and found to give acceptable results.

TI  - Vineyard weed management practices influence nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Successive years of multiple tillage passes have been linked to reductions in soil carbon (C) and shifts in soil physical properties, which are often linked to changes in soil nitrogen (N) retention. ‘Under the vine’ cultivation is becoming a more common practice in vineyards as growers seek alternative means of weed control. Therefore, we (1) investigated the effects of cultivation or herbicide on soil N leaching during a 1 year cycle of vineyard management and (2) determined differences in short-term nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions and N transformations between ‘under the vine’ treatments during summer fertigation, a period in which we hypothesized that high N 2 O emission rates would occur under warm, moist soil conditions. Few differences were found in the chemical and physical characteristics of soil profiles in cultivated and herbicide treatments. In the surface depths, total C and microbial biomass (i.e., total phospholipid fatty acids) were greater in the tilled than herbicide soils. This contrasts with other findings, but suggests that the greater weed biomass in the tilled treatment contributed labile C to soil C pools. Greater soil nitrate was found at depth (1.2 m) in the herbicide than cultivated treatment. Also, the cultivated soil had nearly 50% less nitrous oxide emissions during fertigation than the herbicide soil. We suggest that greater weed presence, soil C and microbial biomass in the tilled treatment contributed to the greater N retention.

TI  - Fertilisation and weed control effects on yield and weeds in durum wheat grown under rain-fed conditions in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary A field study was undertaken to examine the effect of fertiliser type and weed control system on grain yield, yield components and weed population in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum. var. durum) grown in a 4-year rotation [bare fallow–barley (Hordeum vulgare)–vetch (Vicia sativa)–wheat]. Fertilisation treatments were: no fertilisation, organic fertilisation with 2500 kg ha−1 of compost (sheep manure and cereal straw) and chemical fertilisation with 100–60–60 kg ha−1 of NPK. Weed-control treatments were: no control, herbicide, harrowing with long-flex spring tines and strip sowing with inter-row hoeing. Chemical fertilisation increased grain yield with respect to the other treatments, amongst which no significant differences were noted. Weed-control systems afforded no improvement in yield compared with controls; indeed, yields obtained using inter-row hoeing were lower. The weed population consisted of a large variety of species, of which the most important were Convolvulus arvensis and Polygonum aviculare. Application of weed-control systems reduced weed density. Herbicide was the most effective, reducing weed biomass by 80%, whilst harrowing and hoeing reduced weed biomass by 40% and 52% respectively. Inter-row hoeing does not appear to be a viable alternative to herbicides, when used as the sole weed control method in a non-diverse cropping system in Mediterranean climates. The lack of response to compost suggests a need for further long-term research.

TI  - Conversion from agriculture to grassland builds soil organic matter on decadal timescales.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) often increases when agricultural fields are con- verted to perennial vegetation, yet decadal scale rates and the mechanisms that underlie SOM accumulation are not clear. We measured SOM accumulation and changes in soil properties on a replicated chronosequence of former agricultural fields in the midwestern United States that spanned 40 years after perennial-grassland establishment. Over this time period, soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top 10 cm of soil accumulated at a constant rate of 62.0 g·m 22 ·yr 21 , regardless of whether the vegetation type was dominated by C3 or C4 grasses. At this rate, SOC contents will be equivalent to unplowed native prairie sites within 55-75 years after cultivation ceased. Both labile (short turnover time) and recalcitrant (long turnover time) carbon pools increased linearly for 40 years, with recalcitrant pools increas- ing more rapidly than expected. This result was consistent across several different methods of measuring labile SOC. A model that investigates the mechanisms of SOM formation suggests that rapid formation of stable carbon resulted from biochemically resistant mi- crobial products and plant material. Former agricultural soils of the Great Plains may function as carbon sinks for less than a century, although much of the carbon stored is stable.

TI  - An approach to the genetics of nitrogen use efficiency in maize
PY  - 2004
AB  - To study the genetic variability and the genetic basis of nitrogen (N) use efficiency in maize, a set of recombinant inbred lines crossed with a tester was studied at low input (N-) and high input (N+) for grain yield and its components, grain protein content, and post-anthesis nitrogen uptake and remobilization. Other physiological traits, such as nitrate content, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate dehydrogenase activities were studied at the level of the lines. Genotypexnitrogen (GxN) interaction was significant for yield and explained by variation in kernel number. In N-, N-uptake, the nitrogen nutrition index, and GS activity in the vegetative stage were positively correlated with grain yield, whereas leaf senescence was negatively correlated. Whatever N-input, post-anthesis N-uptake was highly negatively related to N-remobilization. As a whole, genetic variability was expressed differently in N+ and N-. This was confirmed by the detection of QTLs. More QTLs were detected in N+ than in N- for traits of vegetative development, N-uptake, and grain yield and its components, whereas it was the reverse for grain protein content and N-utilization efficiency. Several coincidences between genes encoding for enzymes of N metabolism and QTLs for the traits studied were observed. In particular, coincidences in three chromosome regions of QTLs for yield and N-remobilization, QTLs for GS activity and a gene encoding cytosolic GS were observed. This may have a physiological meaning. The GS locus on chromosome 5 appears to be a good candidate gene which can, at least partially, explain the variation in nitrogen use efficiency.

TI  - Preindustrial agriculture versus organic agriculture: The land cost of sustainability
PY  - 2009
AB  - The study of traditional agrarian systems can provide useful knowledge for improving the sustainability of present-day agriculture. Nonetheless, with the loss of traditional agro-ecosystems and the rationale that guides them, as has happened in Europe, an historical research approach can have a decisive role to play in recapturing this knowledge. In this article we study the evolution of a typical Mediterranean agro-ecosystem during the last 250 years, supporting the claim that high diversity and the internalization of energy flows and nutrient cycles found in traditional agriculture, are not only characteristics of the greatest sustainability of such systems, but are based in the need for additional land in production. This claim requires the dedication of land to diverse and complementary uses that leave a footprint on the landscape. Organic agriculture needs to consider this “land cost”, meanwhile trying to minimize it in order to improve its actual degree of sustainability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in soil carbon and nitrogen following tillage conversion in a long-term experiment in Northern France
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract Although continuous no-till (NT) is recommended for erosion control and carbon sequestration, it often has a limited duration since farmers alternate between NT and full inversion tillage (FIT) to control weed infestation and avoid soil compaction. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of continuous tillage and tillage conversion of NT to FIT and vice versa on SOC and SON stocks, in a long-term experiment at Boigneville in Northern France. Continuous NT (CNT) and FIT (CFIT) treatments were established in 1991 and maintained until 2011 while half of the plots were converted in 2005: from CNT to new FIT (NFIT) and CFIT to new NT (NNT). Bulk densities and organic C and N contents were determined in 2001 and 2011 down to the old ploughing depth ( opd ) which was also measured. SOC and SON stocks were calculated at equivalent soil mass by correcting either bulk densities or the opd . Both methods produced very close results and similar conclusions. A typical gradient of SOC and SON concentrations vs depth was observed in CNT as opposed to a rather uniform distribution in CFIT. CNT resulted in SOC concentration in the top soil (0–5 cm) higher by 38% in 2001 and 53% in 2011 compared to CFIT. Conversely, it led to a SOC reduction in the deeper layer ( ca . 10–28 cm) by 14% in 2001 and 18% in 2011. The global effect was no significant change in SOC and SON stocks between treatments over the old ploughed layer (4060 t soil ha −1 ) in both years: 43.2 and 45.0 t C ha −1 in 2001 and 44.7 and 45.8 t C ha −1 in 2011, in CNT and CFIT, respectively. In 2011, six years after tillage conversion, the stratification of SOC and SON had disappeared in NFIT whereas a new one had appeared in NNT with a smaller gradient than in CNT. SOC or SON stocks over the old ploughed layer did not differ significantly between treatments after 6 years of conversion: SOC stocks were 45.8, 43.2, 44.7 and 43.1 t C ha −1 in the CFIT, NFIT, CNT and NNT treatments, respectively. Furthermore, SOC stocks below the old ploughed layer ( ca . 28–40 cm) were slightly greater in FIT than in NT treatment (10.9 vs 8.7 t C ha −1 ). In this experiment, continuous or conversion tillage did not result in any C sequestration benefit.

TI  - Differences in the nitrogen use efficiency of perennial ryegrass varieties under simulated rotational grazing and their effects on nitrogen recovery and herbage nitrogen content
PY  - 2000
AB  - Eight varieties of perennial ryegrass (six new varieties and two old ones) grown at five levels of applied fertilizer (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 kg of N ha–1) were cut monthly during two growing seasons (March to October in 1997 and 1998) and their herbage dry-matter (DM) yield and nitrogen (N) content were determined. Herbage leaf content and the N content of young fully expanded leaves were also measured in 1997, and monthly recovery of applied N was determined in both the first and second harvest years by using 15N.



The rank order of varieties was similar for annual yield of DM and N at all five fertilizer levels. Proportional differences between varieties in DM yield were greatest in the first cut of each year, the late-heading candidate variety Ba12151 out-yielding the old late-heading variety S23 by more than 70%. However, differences in annual DM yield were much more modest than in early spring yield, up to 10% in 1997 and up to 21% in 1998. The relatively small differences in total annual DM yield were attributed to only a small proportion of the applied N being recovered during a single regrowth period, most of the remainder becoming available for uptake in subsequent regrowth periods.



There were small but highly statistically significant differences among varieties in the N content of their leaves, leaf N content being inversely related to yield of DM and N. This lends further support to the hypothesis that the metabolic cost of protein synthesis and turnover is a key factor controlling genetic variation both in leaf yield and in annual DM and N yield under frequent harvesting. Seasonal variation in herbage N content was much greater than differences among varieties in mean N content over all harvests. In May of both years at all applied fertilizer levels, herbage N content fell below the 20 g N kg–1 DM level required by productive grazing animals.

TI  - Regionalised inventory of biogenic greenhouse gas emissions from European agriculture
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract This study develops a detailed methodology compatible to the Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the annual direct biogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) released from European agriculture. This approach relies on emission factors and regression equations derived from all long-term measurements in Europe available by the end of 2001. Applying the methodology, the biogenic GHG emissions from agriculture within the European Union (EU) and within its Member States are calculated for the period from 1975 to 1997 at a spatial resolution of regions or federal states (NUTS 1–2 level). As a result, in 1995, European agriculture emitted 0.84±0.19 Tg N 2 O, 8.1±2.0 Tg CH 4 and 39 Tg±25 CO 2 , which adds up to 470±80 Tg CO 2 -equivalents or 11% of the overall GHG emissions. At the EU level, these numbers are surprisingly close to the official inventory submitted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). But compared with the latter, the approach taken here leads to higher agricultural CH 4 emissions in Austria and the Netherlands, at least 20% lower CH 4 emissions in Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain and Sweden and higher N 2 O emissions in most EU Member States. In countries with—even small—areas of farmed organic soils, CO 2 emitted from peat oxidation can significantly contribute to the overall emissions. Hence, only the detailed approach adequately resolves regional and national specifics of agricultural conditions. It furthermore reduces the uncertainty in the emissions estimates to half of the one in inventories based on the IPCC Guidelines. Fair agreement with inverse atmospheric models was achieved. These results suggest that the methodology developed and applied here could serve as a significantly improved standard for official inventories of biogenic GHG emissions from EU Member States.

TI  - Polyphenol Oxidase and o‐Diphenols Inhibit Postharvest Proteolysis in Red Clover and Alfalfa
PY  - 2006
AB  - Many forages experience significant proteolytic losses when preserved by ensiling. Such losses in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) are especially high, with degradation of 44 to 87% of the forage protein to nonprotein N (NPN). In contrast, red clover {Trifolium pratense L.) has up to 90% less proteolysis during ensiling. Here we demonstrate that the combination of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and o-diphenol PPO substrates, both abundantly present in red clover, is responsible for postharvest proteolytic inhibition in this forage crop. Proteolysis in red clover leaf extracts increased nearly fivefold when endogenous o-diphenols were removed by gel filtration but returned to starting levels by adding back an exogenous o-diphenol. Proteolysis in leaf extracts of red clover plants silenced for PPO expression was dramatically increased compared to control plants. Leaf extracts of transgenic alfalfa expressing a red clover PPO gene showed a nearly fivefold o-diphenol-dependent decrease in proteolysis compared to those of control alfalfa. We also demonstrate that PPO levels 10- to 20-fold lower than those typically found in red clover are sufficient for proteolytic inhibition, that as little as 0.25 μmol o-diphenol mg -1 protein has a substantial impact on proteolysis, that a wide variety of o-diphenols are functional substrates in proteolytic inhibition, and that proteolysis is reduced for PPO-expressing alfalfa in small-scale ensiling experiments. Together, these results indicate that PPO and o-diphenols can be an effective treatment to prevent protein loss in ensiled forage crops.

TI  - Estimation of nitrous oxide emission from Hungarian semi-arid sandy and loess grasslands; effect of soil parameters, grazing, irrigation and use of fertilizer
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) is emitted into the atmosphere in substantial quantities as an intermediate product of mainly denitrification processes and soil nitrification. N2O emission from Hungarian sandy and loess type soils has been measured between August 2002 and December 2004. The effects of soil parameters and different farming activities (grazing exclusion, irrigation and mineral fertilization) on the rate of emission were investigated. Soil N2O efflux was determined by measuring the accumulation of N2O in 10 parallel small (V = 400 cm3, A = 80 cm2) static chambers. Samples were taken with evacuated tubes followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. Emission from sandy grassland under extensive farming proved to be negligible below soil temperature of 5 °C, the mean fluxes at tsoil > 10 °C and tsoil

TI  - Conservation Tillage Influence on Carbon Dynamics Under Mediterranean Conditions
PY  - 2014
AB  - Intensity of tillage practices can enhance organic matter decomposition, increasing CO2 emissions from soil to the atmosphere. Conservation tillage (CT) has been proposed as a means of counteracting potential damages to the environment. In this study the effects of two CT systems, reduced tillage in a long-term experiment (RTL) and no-tillage in a short-term experiment (NTS), were compared to traditional tillage (TT) in the long (TTL) and short-term experiments (TTS). CO2 fluxes, total soil organic carbon (SOC) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were evaluated at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm depths throughout the three years studied (Oct. 2006-Jul. 2009). Traditional tillage increased CO2 emissions compared to CT. The CT treatments (RTL and NTS) accumulated more SOC in the surface layer (0-5 cm) than the TT treatments (TTL and TTS). SOC accumulation was moderate but DHA consistently increased in CT in the surface soil, especially with a legume crop included in the crop rotation. Values of stratification ratio of all parameters studied were higher in the CT treatments (RTL and NTS). The agricultural and environmental benefits derived from CT make this system recommendable for semi-arid Mediterranean rain-fed agriculture.

TI  - A review of nitrogen fertilizer and conservation tillage effects on soil organic carbon storage
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer and tillage systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage have been tested in many field experiments worldwide. The published results of this research are here compiled for evaluation of the impact of management practices on carbon sequestration. Paired data from 137 sites with varying nitrogen rates and 161 sites with contrasting tillage systems were included. Nitrogen fertilizer increased SOC but only when crop residues were returned to the soil; a multiple regression model accounted for just over half the variance (R2=0.56, P=0.001). The model included as independent variables: cumulative nitrogen fertilizer rate; rainfall; temperature; soil texture; and a cropping intensity index, calculated as a combination of the number of crops per year and percentage of corn in the rotation. Carbon sequestration increased as more nitrogen was applied to the system, and as rainfall or cropping intensity increased. At sites with higher mean temperatures and also in fine textured soils, carbon sequestration decreased. When the carbon costs of production, transportation and application of fertilizer are subtracted from the carbon sequestration predicted by the model, it appears that nitrogen fertilizer-use in tropical regions results in no additional carbon sequestration, whereas in temperate climates, it appears to promote net carbon sequestration. No differences in SOC were found between reduced till (chisel, disc, and sweep till) and no-till, whereas conventional tillage (mouldboard plough, disc plough) was associated with less SOC. The accumulation of SOC under conservation tillage (reduced and no till) was an S-shape time dependent process, which reached a steady state after 25–30 years, but this relationship only accounted for 26% of the variance. Averaging out SOC differences in all the experiments under conservation tillage, there was an increase of 2.1 t C ha−1 over ploughing. However, when only those cases that had apparently reached equilibrium were included (all no till vs. conventional tillage comparisons from temperate regions), mean SOC increased by approximately 12 t C ha−1. This estimate is larger than others previously reported. Carbon sequestration under conservation tillage was not significantly related to climate, soil texture or rotation.

TI  - Compost Organic Amendments in Fodder Crops: Effects on Yield, Nitrogen Utilization and Soil Characteristics
PY  - 2006
AB  - Agronomic value and environmental impact of two composts were evaluated in a three-year field experiment (2002, 2003 and 2004) on alfalfa and cocksfoot in Southern Italy. The effects of Municipal Solid Waste compost (MSW), Olive Pomace Compost (OPC), mineral fertilizer (Min) (phosphorus as 75 kg ha−1 for alfalfa and nitrogen as 50 kg ha−1 for cocksfoot) and an unfertilized treatment (Contr) were compared on crop yield, soil characteristics and environment impact. During the cropping cycles, fresh and dry weights, plant nitrogen status (leaves SPAD readings and petiole nitrate content) and plant total N content were determined for calculating the protein content and the plant N uptake. Moreover, at the beginning and the end of the research, chemical soil characteristics and heavy metal levels were also determined. The results indicated that in cocksfoot fertilized with MSW and OPC composts, the mean cumulative dry weight increased by 20.85 and 16.51%, respectively compared to the control, but it was signif...

TI  - Nitrogen fertilizer: Retrospect and prospect
PY  - 1999
AB  - The rising fertilizer use accompanying more people eating more has been called exponential (1) and prompted fears of polluted water and consequent methemoglobinemia (2) and hypoxia (3). It also has raised alarm about greenhouse warming (4) and an altered global N cycle and thus primary production (5) and diversity (1) of vegetation. In this plethora of issues we concentrate on a few, beginning with the fundamental one of how fast N fertilizer use has risen in the world and in an industrial nation, the United States, where early, rapid adoption may foretell the course in the world. We also shall explore how much deposition of N from the atmosphere has increased. After examining the changing ratio of fertilizer N application to its intended incorporation in crop yield, we shall discuss prospects for more or less N fertilizer by 2070 when the earth’s farmers may be feeding 10 billion people and sparing more or less habitat for nature.

Because nitrogen (N) comprises fully 16% of protein, neither we, other animals, nor plants grow and survive unless roots extract it from the soil. Medieval wheat crops of only 1,000 kg hectare (ha)−1 extracted 21 kg of N (6). Some N deposited by precipitation or fixed by legumes helped replenish the supply. By rotating their wheat crops onto one of the other, say, 4 ha of the farm or collecting manure from it, medieval farmers could complete the replacement of the N annually removed by 1 ha of wheat. The farm could sustain only a few people because N inevitably escapes from the cycle of deposition, fixation, crops, and animals, and each person requires at least 3 kg of N per year (7).

During the 19th century, mining Chilean nitrate and Peruvian guano somewhat relieved this …

TI  - Towards accurate measurements of soil organic carbon stock change in agroecosystems
PY  - 2006
AB  - In response to Kyoto Protocol commitments, countries can elect agricultural carbon sinks to offset emissions from other sectors, but they need to verify soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change. We summarize issues we see as barriers to obtaining accurate measures of SOC change, including: soil depth, bulk density and equivalent soil mass, representation of landscape components, experimental design, and the equilibrium status of the SOC. If the entire plow depth is not considered, rates of SOC storage under conservation compared with conventional tillage can be overstated. Bulk density must be measured to report SOC stock on an area basis. More critical still is the need to report SOC stock on an equivalent mass basis to normalize the effects of management on bulk density. Most experiments comparing SOC under differing management have been conducted in small, flat research plots. Although results obtained from these long-term experiments have been useful to develop and validate SOC prediction models, they d...

TI  - Greenhouse gas mitigation in agriculture
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural lands occupy 37% of the earth's land surface. Agriculture accounts for 52 and 84% of global anthropogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agricultural soils may also act as a sink or source for CO2, but the net flux is small. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management and restoration of degraded lands and cultivated organic soils. Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management. The global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030, considering all gases, is estimated to be approximately 5500–6000 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1, with economic potentials of approximately 1500–1600, 2500–2700 and 4000–4300 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1 at carbon prices of up to 20, up to 50 and up to 100 US$ t CO2-eq.−1, respectively. In addition, GHG emissions could be reduced by substitution of fossil fuels for energy production by agricultural feedstocks (e.g. crop residues, dung and dedicated energy crops). The economic mitigation potential of biomass energy from agriculture is estimated to be 640, 2240 and 16 000 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1 at 0–20, 0–50 and 0–100 US$ t CO2-eq.−1, respectively.

TI  - Effect of long-term conservation tillage on soil biochemical properties in Mediterranean Spanish areas
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract In semi-arid Mediterranean areas, studies of the performance of conservation tillage systems have largely demonstrated advantages in crop yield, soil water storage and soil protection against wind and water erosion. However, little attention has been given to interactions between soil biochemical properties under different tillage practices. Biochemical properties are useful tools to assess changes caused by different soil tillage systems in long-term field experiments. This study deals with the effect of long-term tillage practices (reduced tillage and no-tillage vs. traditional tillage) on soil chemical properties and microbial functions in three different sites of Spain (two of them located in the Northeast and one in the Southwest) under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. Soil biological status, as index of soil quality, was evaluated by measuring microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase (an oxidoreductase) and protease (a hydrolase) activities at three soil depths (0–5, 5–10 and 10–25 cm). In the three experimental areas, increases in soil organic matter content, MBC and enzymatic activities were found at the superficial layers of soil under conservation tillage (reduced tillage and no-tillage) in comparison with traditional tillage. Values of the stratification ratio of some biochemical properties were significantly correlated with yield production in Northeast sites. Conservation tillage has proven to be an effective strategy to improve soil quality and fertility in Mediterranean areas of Spain.

TI  - Towards an agronomic assessment of N2O emissions: a case study for arable crops
PY  - 2010
AB  - Agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O), largely because of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use. Commonly, N2O emissions are expressed as a function of N application rate. This suggests that smaller fertilizer applications always lead to smaller N2O emissions. Here we argue that, because of global demand for agricultural products, agronomic conditions should be included when assessing N2O emissions. Expressing N2O emissions in relation to crop productivity (expressed as above-ground N uptake: ‘yield-scaled N2O emissions') can express the N2O efficiency of a cropping system. We show how conventional relationships between N application rate, N uptake and N2O emissions can result in minimal yield-scaled N2O emissions at intermediate fertilizer-N rates. Key findings of a meta-analysis on yield-scaled N2O emissions by non-leguminous annual crops (19 independent studies and 147 data points) revealed that yield-scaled N2O emissions were smallest (8.4 g N2O-N kg-1N uptake) at application rates of approximately 180–190 kg N ha-1 and increased sharply after that (26.8 g N2O-N kg-1 N uptake at 301 kg N ha-1). If the above-ground N surplus was equal to or smaller than zero, yield-scaled N2O emissions remained stable and relatively small. At an N surplus of 90 kg N ha-1 yield-scaled emissions increased threefold. Furthermore, a negative relation between N use efficiency and yield-scaled N2O emissions was found. Therefore, we argue that agricultural management practices to reduce N2O emissions should focus on optimizing fertilizer-N use efficiency under median rates of N input, rather than on minimizing N application rates.

TI  - Atmospheric inversions for estimating CO 2 fluxes: methods and perspectives
PY  - 2010
AB  - We provide a review description of atmospheric inversion methods for the determination of fluxes of long-lived trace gases based on measurements of atmospheric concentration. Emphasis is given to technical aspects of inversion settings, which are crucial to inter-compare and understand inversion results. We briefly sketch the formalism used in such methods, then provide a summary of major currents in research and contemporary problems. Most attention is given to carbon dioxide (CO2) which poses the threat of future climate change. Therefore, there is keen interest in better understanding where and when CO2 emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels is reabsorbed by land ecosystems and oceans. Using the information contained in concentration fields observed from ground-based networks and from upcoming satellite observations in order to constrain the geographic distribution of surface fluxes is an inverse problem; it consists of finding a set of fluxes that optimally matches the observations available. We review the application of inverse methods to quantify the distribution of the sources and sinks of CO2 at the surface of the Earth based on global measurements of atmospheric concentration and three-dimensional models of atmospheric transport. We describe the use of top–down atmospheric inversion methods in terms of numerical transport modeling and atmospheric observation networks, and detail some of the currently important issues in assigning uncertainties.

TI  - Nitrous oxide production and denitrification in Scottish arable soils
PY  - 1991
AB  - SUMMARY

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and concentrations in the soil atmosphere were measured at a number of sites of differing soil type in south-east Scotland between 1985 and 1988. Concentrations followed log-normal distributions and were significantly affected by soil type, tillage treatment, and nitrate application rate. The shape of the profiles suggested significant consumption in the upper 5 cm, making calculations of emission rates using Fick's Law unsatisfactory. Emission rates measured using closed flux chambers were at least one order of magnitude smaller from heavier-textured arable soils than from lighter ones.



Denitrification fluxes measured by field application of the acetylene inhibition technique were lowest in a clay loam, and highest in an alluvial sandy loam; this was attributed to a failure to achieve a satisfactory distribution of acetylene in the heavier soil. Denitrification rates in soil cores generally exceeded measured surface fluxes; incubation at decreased oxygen concentrations typical of those measured in the field produced a further significant increase. Core incubation should be used as an alternative to in situ field measurement only if the oxygen concentration in the incubation vessels is adjusted to mimic that in the field; otherwise denitrification rates may be significantly underestimated.

TI  - MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND SOIL STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH CORN, GRASSES, AND LEGUMES
PY  - 1991
AB  - Maintaining long-term soil productivity requires development of cropping systems that provide maintenance or improvement in soil structure and an understanding of associated rhizosphere microbial populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of several crops on soil biomass C and biomass N contents, their within-season variability, and the relationships between changes in soil biomass C, biomass N, and soil structure on a Brookston clay loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Argiaquoll). Soil microbial biomass C, biomass N, and soil-structure parameters (wet aggregate stability [WAS], organic carbon [OC], dry aggregate mean weight diameter [MWD], bulk density, and total and air-filled porosity) were measured during the third year of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max [L.], Merr.) alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and no-crop (bare, covered, and shaded) plots at monthly intervals (June, July, August, and September). Reed canarygrass resulted in greater biomass-C contents than both the corn and soybean at all four sampling dates. Soil biomass C under alfalfa was significantly greater than under corn and soybean for both the first and last sampling dates. Forage species did not affect the soil biomass-N content. No consistent effects of the no-crop treatment on biomass C or biomass N were observed between sampling dates. Biomass C was significantly correlated with WAS, OC, and MWD for the cropping treatments. Wet aggregate stability was negatively correlated with soil water content for both the no-crop and cropping treatments, indicating that improvements in structure were not solely the result of the cropping treatments and associated rhizosphere populations. Reed canarygrass resulted in greater soil biomass C/N than the alfalfa, corn, and orchard grass plots, suggesting that fungal activity, and therefore soil structure, may be preferentially enhanced in the presence of reed canarygrass. This study demonstrated the influence of forage species and seasonal variability on concurrent changes in microbial biomass and soil structural properties.

TI  - Long-Term Effects of Organic Amendments on Soil Fertility
PY  - 2011
AB  - Common agricultural practices such as excessive use of agro-chemicals, deep tillage and luxury irrigation have degraded soils, polluted water resources and contaminated the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about interrelated environmental problems such as soil degradation, desertification, erosion, and accelerated greenhouse effects and climate change. The decline in organic matter content of many soils is becoming a major process of soil degradation, particularly in European semi-arid Mediterranean regions. Degraded soils are not fertile and thus cannot maintain sustainable production. At the same time, the production of urban and industrial organic waste materials is widespread. Therefore, strategies for recycling such organic waste in agriculture must be developed. Here, we review long-term experiments (3–60 years) on the effects of organic amendments used both for organic matter replenishment and to avoid the application of high levels of chemical fertilizers. The major points of our analysis are: (1) many effects, e.g. carbon sequestration in the soil and possible build-up of toxic elements, evolve slowly, so it is necessary to refer to long-term trials. (2) Repeated application of exogenous organic matter to cropland led to an improvement in soil biological functions. For instance, microbial biomass carbon increased by up to 100% using high-rate compost treatments, and enzymatic activity increased by 30% with sludge addition. (3) Long-lasting application of organic amendments increased organic carbon by up to 90% versus unfertilized soil, and up to 100% versus chemical fertilizer treatments. (4) Regular addition of organic residues, particularly the composted ones, increased soil physical fertility, mainly by improving aggregate stability and decreasing soil bulk density. (5) The best agronomic performance of compost is often obtained with the highest rates and frequency of applications. Furthermore, applying these strategies, there were additional beneficial effects such as the slow release of nitrogen fertilizer. (6) Crop yield increased by up to 250% by long-term applications of high rates of municipal solid waste compost. Stabilized organic amendments do not reduce the crop yield quality, but improve it. (7) Organic amendments play a positive role in climate change mitigation by soil carbon sequestration, the size of which is dependent on their type, the rates and the frequency of application. (8) There is no tangible evidence demonstrating negative impacts of heavy metals applied to soil, particularly when high-quality compost was used for long periods. (9) Repeated application of composted materials enhances soil organic nitrogen content by up to 90%, storing it for mineralization in future cropping seasons, often without inducing nitrate leaching to groundwater.

TI  - Use of N immobilization to tighten the N cycle in conventional agroecosystems
PY  - 2010
AB  - Soils in conventional agroecosystems are purposely held in a nitrogen (N)-saturated state to maximize crop yields. Planting winter annual cover crops when fields are usually fallow has been proposed to ameliorate N losses from soils. In this study we introduced winter annual cover crops into an N rate study with plots fertilized at 0, 34, 67, 101, 134, 168, and 202 kg N/ha in maize (Zea mays L.) to determine how winter annual cover crops affect yields, N2O and NO3− fluxes, and N pools. At the six-leaf stage and during flowering, incorporation of cover crop into soil resulted in a 30% reduction in maize biomass. Three weeks after fertilization, KCl-extractable soil mineral N was 75–87% lower in cover-cropped soils than in no-cover soils, indicating that N had been immobilized in the cover-cropped soils. At physiological maturity, there was no difference between cover and no-cover treatments in crop yield, which was maximized at 9 Mg/ha in 2006 and 7 Mg/ha in 2007. Where N rates exceed crop requirements, co...

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sink capacity of amended soils evaluated under laboratory conditions
PY  - 2007
AB  - Soil sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 through land application of organic residues may have beneficial effects as a strategy to offset the increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The significance of different variables on GHG production and soil C sink capacity was investigated by monitoring CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes from amended soils under laboratory conditions. In the first experiment, the effects of the chemical composition and complexity of three N-rich organic fertilisers (blood meal, hydrolysed leather, and hoof and horn meal) on the CO 2 and N 2 O productions were studied. A second experiment was aimed at evaluating the effects of the degree of transformation of composts prepared from two-phase olive mill waste on soil C sink capacity. The three N-rich organic fertilisers caused different CO 2 and N 2 O evolution patterns in the amended soils, despite their similar elemental composition. The total amount of added C that was mineralised in the soil ranged from 10.4% to 15.5%, while N 2 O-N originating from horn and hoof meal was 6 and 13 times higher than that coming from hydrolysed leather and blood meal, respectively. Mineralisation of the C added to the soil was inversely correlated to the degree of stabilisation of the composting mixtures. Soils amended with the initial composting mixture evolved from 2 to 7.3 times more CO 2 -C than the soil amended with the more stabilised compost. However, the C conservation efficiency of organic residues, calculated by the combined losses during composting, and after land application, was higher for the less transformed organic materials. Both studies showed the key importance of the variables studied on the GHG emissions and C sink efficiency of amended soils under controlled conditions. Laboratory experiments could be a useful tool to assist in the designing of field scale experiments for an effective quantification and monitoring of the overall changes in soil C and N pools.

TI  - Effects of tillage and nitrogen fertilizers on CH4 and CO2 emissions and soil organic carbon in paddy fields of central China.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Quantifying carbon (C) sequestration in paddy soils is necessary to help better understand the effect of agricultural practices on the C cycle. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of tillage practices [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT)] and the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (0 and 210 kg N ha−1) on fluxes of CH4 and CO2, and soil organic C (SOC) sequestration during the 2009 and 2010 rice growing seasons in central China. Application of N fertilizer significantly increased CH4 emissions by 13%–66% and SOC by 21%–94% irrespective of soil sampling depths, but had no effect on CO2 emissions in either year. Tillage significantly affected CH4 and CO2 emissions, where NT significantly decreased CH4 emissions by 10%–36% but increased CO2 emissions by 22%–40% in both years. The effects of tillage on the SOC varied with the depth of soil sampling. NT significantly increased the SOC by 7%–48% in the 0–5 cm layer compared with CT. However, there was no significant difference in the SOC between NT and CT across the entire 0–20 cm layer. Hence, our results suggest that the potential of SOC sequestration in NT paddy fields may be overestimated in central China if only surface soil samples are considered.

TI  - The effect of soil drying on humus decomposition and nitrogen availability
PY  - 1958
AB  - Respirometer experiments show that when a dry soil is moistened a characteristic pattern of decomposition occurs in which an initial period of relatively rapid decomposition (Stage 1) falls, during a few days, to a slow steady rate (Stage 2). This pattern is repetitive with successive dryings and rewettings and is common to all soils so far investigated. The magnitude of decomposition depends in the percent carbon in the soil and on the drying conditions, air-drying being less effective than oven-drying. Decomposition during Stage 1 conforms approximately to a first-order reaction and proportionate amounts of nitrogen are mineralised. A similar pattern of decomposition occurs under field conditions throughout successive wet and dry seasons.

TI  - Changing pH shifts the microbial sourceas well as the magnitude of N2O emission from soil
PY  - 2010
AB  - Here, we examine the effect of long-term pH differences and short-term pH change on N2O emissions from soil, and the microbial source (ammonia oxidation versus denitrification) of 15N-N2O emissions. 15N-fertiliser (20 g N m−2; 10 atom% excess 15N) was applied to (1) a silt loam soil of pH 7 held at 50% and 65% water-filled pore space (WFPS) (experiment 1) and (2) a loamy sand soil maintained at pH 4.5 and pH 7 for over 40 years (experiment 2). Soils were limed with CaCO3 or acidified with H2SO4, and comparisons were made with unadjusted soils. Ammonia oxidation was the main microbial source of 15N-N2O in soils limed to pH 7.0–8.1, unadjusted pH 7.1 (Experiment 1) and long-term pH 7 (experiment 2) soils. Eighty percent of 15N-N2O from the long-term pH 4.5 soil (experiment 2) was derived from denitrification suggesting a possible inhibition of N2O reduction. Short-term acidification to pH 5.6 or 4.3 lowered N2O emissions. Liming of the pH 4.5 soil resulted in over four times greater N2O emission (11 mg 14+15N-N2O m−2 over 41 days) than from the long-term pH 7.0 soil (experiment 2), with an associated increase in ammonia oxidiser-N2O and decrease in denitrifier-N2O production. This is the first report of a pH-induced change in microbial source of N2O. Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing between short- and long-term effects of pH management when predicting N2O emissions from soil, as they exhibit predominance of different microbial groups in N2O production, with likely adaptation of the microbial community.

TI  - Different Nitrogen Fertilization Sources, Soil Tillage, and Crop Rotations in Winter Wheat: Effect on Yield, Quality, and Nitrogen Utilization
PY  - 2009
AB  - ABSTRACT A two-year field study examined the effect of different sources of nitrogen (N) fertilization, soil tillage depths, and crop rotations on winter wheat yield, quality, and N utilization. Nitrogen fertilization treatments were: mineral N at 100 kg N ha−1 (Nmin); municipal solid waste compost at 100 kg N ha−1 of organic N (Ncomp); 50 kg N ha−1 of both compost and mineral N fertilizer (Nmix); unfertilized control (control). Tillage treatments were conventional and minimum tillage applied on the rotations tomato—wheat, sugar beet—wheat, and sunflower—wheat. The Nmix treatment had the highest yield and N uptake (5.29 t ha−1 and 157.9 kg ha−1, respectively). The partial substitution of mineral with organic N fertilizer increased yield by 8% and 33%, and N uptake by 2% and 31%, with respect to Nmin and control treatments, respectively. In comparison with Nmin, Nmix had a higher stability in these parameters throughout years and rotations, and no reduction in grain protein level and in N utilization. Conv...

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from a Northern Great Plains soil as influenced by nitrogen management and cropping systems.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Field measurements of N 2 O emissions from soils are limited for cropping systems in the semiarid notthern Great Plains (NGP). The objectives were to develop N 2 O emission-time profiles for cropping systems in the semiarid NGP, define important periods of loss, determine the impact of best management practices on N 2 O losses, and estimate direct N fertilizer-induced emissions (FIE). No-till (NT) wheat (Triticum Aestivum L)-fallow, wheat-wheat, and wheat-pea (Pisum sativum), and conventional till (CT) wheat-fallow, all with three N regimes (200 and 100 kg N ha -1 available N, unferatilized control); plus a perennial grass: alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) system were sampled over 2 yr using vented chambers. Cumulative 2-yr N 2 O emissions were modest in contrast to reports from more humid regions. Greatest N 2 O flux activity occurred fullowing urea-N fertilization (10-wk) and during freeze-thaw cycles. Together these periods comprised up to 84% of the 2-yr total. Nitrification was probably the dominant process responsible for N 2 O emissions during the post-N fertilization period, while denitrification was more important during freeze-thaw cycles. Cumulative 2-yr N 2 O-N losses from fertilized regimes were greater for wheat-wheat (1.31 kg N ha -1 ) than wheat-fallow (CT and NT) (0.48 kg N ha -1 ), and wheat-pea (0.71 kg N ha -1 ) due to an additional N fertilization event. Cumulative losses from unfertilized cropping systems were not different from perennial grass-alfalfa (0.28 kg N ha -1 ). Tillage did not affect N 2 O losses for the wheat-fallow systems. Mean FIE level was equivalent to 0.26% of applied N, and considerably below the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change mean default value (1.25%).

TI  - Nitrogen oxide and methane emissions under varying tillage and fertilizer management.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Comprehensive assessment of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) budget of reduced tillage agricultural systems must consider emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), each of which have higher global warming potentials than carbon dioxide (CO2). Tillage intensity may also impact nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which can have various environmental and agronomic impacts. In 2003 and 2004, we used chambers to measure N2O, CH4, and NO fluxes from plots that had been managed under differing tillage intensity since 1991. The effect of tillage on non-CO2 GHG emissions varied, in both magnitude and direction, depending on fertilizer practices. Emissions of N2O following broadcast urea (BU) application were higher under no till (NT) and conservation tillage (CsT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). In contrast, following anhydrous ammonia (AA) injection, N2O emissions were higher under CT and CsT compared to NT. Emissions following surface urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) application did not vary with tillage. Total growing season non-CO2 GHG emissions were equivalent to CO2 emissions of 0.15 to 1.9 Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) or 0.04 to 0.53 Mg soil-C ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions of N2O from AA-amended plots were two to four times greater than UAN- and BU-amended plots. Total NO + N2O losses in the UAN treatment were approximately 50% lower than AA and BU. This study demonstrates that N2O emissions can represent a substantial component of the total GHG budget of reduced tillage systems, and that interactions between fertilizer and tillage practices can be important in controlling non-CO2 GHG emissions.

TI  - Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from Canadian animal agriculture: A review
PY  - 2006
AB  - Considerable evidence of climate change associated with emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) has resulted in international efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The agriculture sector contributes about 8% of GHG emissions in Canada mostly through methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The objective of this paper was to compile an integrative review of CH4 and N2O emissions from livestock by taking a whole cycle approach from enteric fermentation to manure treatment and storage, and field application of manure. Basic microbial processes that result in CH4 production in the rumen and hindgut of animals were reviewed. An overview of CH4 and N2O production processes in manure, and controlling factors are presented. Most of the studies conducted in relation to enteric fermentation were in dairy and beef cattle. To date, research has focussed on GHG emissions from the stored manures of dairy, beef cattle and swine; therefore, we focus our review on these. Several methods used to measure GHG emissions from livestock a...

TI  - Tillage and N fertilization: Effects on N dynamics and Barley yield under semiarid Mediterranean conditions
PY  - 2006
AB  - Reducing tillage and optimizing nitrogen fertilization are important strategies for soil and water conservation and
sustainability of Mediterranean agricultural systems. These interacting practices can alter soil water and N availability, and
thus affect N uptake, water use efficiency and crop yield. Three levels of N fertilization (zero, medium and high) and three tillage
intensities (none, minimum and conventional tillage) were evaluated at three locations of the Ebro Valley in northeast Spain with
different degrees of aridity and soil types (Guissona, Agramunt and Candasnos). Uptake of N by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)
was two to three times greater with N fertilization at locations with the best yield potential. Tillage increased soil mineral N
content depending on location. Losses of N ranged from 30 to 80% of applied N each year and were encouraged by high N
fertilization rates. Recovery of applied N ranged from 28 to 46.5%. N use efficiency ranged from 13 to 80 kg kg 1 N and was
negatively affected by N fertilization up to 50% and by tillage up to 17%. It is thus found that farmer applications of N fertilizer
can be reduced by up to 50%. No-till systems do not require increased amounts of N fertilizer for barley production in these
areas. Only in wet years, higher yields are obtained in no till when some N fertilizer is applied. However, in dry years with scarce
rainfall during autumn, N should not be applied in any tillage system. Reduced tillage and no till are suitable systems for
improving yield and for optimal environmental and economical use of N in these Mediterranean conditions.

TI  - Measuring Adsorption Isotherms Using Continuous, Unsaturated Flow through Intact Soil Cores
PY  - 1992
AB  - Conventional batch adsorption-isotherm experiments are conducted under conditions that are generally not representative of field conditions. Our objective was to develop and illustrate a technique that uses continuous, Unsaturated flow through intact soil cores and gives information analogous to standard batch absorption experiments. Soil cores were placed on filter funnels and continuous flow was induced by controlled vacuum. Solution, 10 times the weight of the soil, was applied and recycled until apparent equilibrium concentrations were observed. While the total solution-to-soil ratio was 10:1, the amount in contact with soil at any instant was small. The procedure was replicated on separate cores with different initial solute concentrations to give different final equilibrium concentrations as a function of solute adsorbed per gram of soil. The technique was illustrated by observing adsorption of forest floor dissolved organic C to cores of AB horizon soil, and was compared with conventional batch adsorption data. Isotherms using both methods were linear but the slope of the batch isotherm was somewhat less. This flowthrough technique provides a way to obtain adsorption-isotherm data under more realistic

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions under conservation agriculture compared to traditional cultivation of maize in the central highlands of Mexico.
PY  - 2012
AB  - In 1991, the ‘International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’ (CIMMYT) started a field experiment in the rain fed Mexican highlands to investigate conservation agriculture (CA) as a sustainable alternative for conventional maize production practices (CT). CT techniques, characterized by deep tillage, monoculture and crop residue removal, have deteriorated soil fertility and reduced yields. CA, which combines minimum tillage, crop rotations and residue retention, restores soil fertility and increases yields. Soil organic matter increases in CA compared to CT, but increases in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in CA might offset the gains obtained to mitigate global warming. Therefore, CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions, soil temperature, C and water content were monitored in CA and CT treatments in 2010–2011. The cumulative GHG emitted were similar for CA and CT in both years, but the C content in the 0–60 cm layer was higher in CA (117.7 Mg C ha− 1) than in CT (69.7 Mg C ha− 1). The net global warming potential (GWP) of CA (considering soil C sequestration, GHG emissions, fuel use, and fertilizer and seeds production) was − 7729 kg CO2 ha− 1 y− 1 in 2008–2009 and − 7892 kg CO2 ha− 1 y− 1 in 2010–2011, whereas that of CT was 1327 and 1156 kg CO2 ha− 1 y− 1. It was found that the contribution of CA to GWP was small compared to that of CT.

TI  - Avaliação de atributos físicos e estoques de carbono e nitrogênio em solos com queima e sem queima de canavial Evaluation of physical properties and soil carbon and nitrogen stocks as affected by burning or green trash management of sugarcane
PY  - 2008
AB  - Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane producer, so changes in sugarcane management in Brazil can affect the environment to a great extent. During almost one century, studies were carried out in cropping systems involving pre-harvest burning of aerial sugarcane residues. Nowadays the green trash management of sugarcane residues has become a common practice, although the effects are still poorly documented. The objective of this work was to compare topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks, aggregation and bulk density in Brazilian sugarcane plantations where aerial residues were either burned (Cq) or left on the soil surface (Sq) after harvest. The study was carried out in three plantations, one on a clayey soil (Latossolo Vermelho, LVdf, i.e. Typic Hapludox) and two on sandy soils (Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo, PVAd, i.e. Typic Hapludult, and Neossolo Quartzarenico, RQo, i.e. Quartzpsamment). On each plantation, the experimental design included six replications per treatment. After three crops, the accumulated aerial residue biomass in Sq treatment amounted to 40 t ha-1 of DM from which 4.5 and 3.6 t ha-1 of DM (i.e. 11 and 9 %) were still present at the soil surface in LVdf and RQo, respectively. This represented 1.60 and 1.35 t ha-1 of C and 0.022 and 0.021 t ha-1 of N, respectively. As a result, soil carbon at a 0-20 cm depth increased by 6.3 and 4.7 t ha-1 in LVdf and RQo, respectively. Over the three-year period, the rate of carbon sequestration in the litter and topsoil in the Sq treatment was 2.63 and 2.02 t ha-1 yr-1 in LVdf and RQo, respectively. Topsoil content of stable macroaggregates was also higher with Sq than with Cq: 814 vs. 693 g kg-1 in LVdf, and 516 vs, 420 g kg-1 in RQo, respectively. On the other hand, Sq caused topsoil compaction (PVAd and RQo) due to the mechanized harvest system. In the Brazilian soils under study, green trash management of sugarcane residues improved the topsoil properties and promoted carbon and nitrogen sequestration in the litter and topsoil.

TI  - Soil organic matter, biota and aggregation in temperate and tropical soils - Effects of no-tillage
PY  - 2002
AB  - The long-term stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) in tropical and temperate regions is mediated by soil biota (e.g. fungi, bacte- ria, roots and earthworms), soil structure (e.g. aggregation) and their interactions. On average, soil C turnover was twice as fast in tropical com- pared with temperate regions, but no major differences were observed in SOM quality between the two regions. Probably due to the soil mineralogy dominated by 1:1 clay minerals and oxides in tropical regions, we found a higher aggregate stability, but a lower correlation between C contents and aggregate stability in tropical soils. In addition, a smaller amount of C associated with clay and silt particles was observed in tro- pical versus temperate soils. In both tropical and temperate soils, a general increase in C levels (≈ 325 ± 113 kg C·ha -1 ·yr -1 ) was observed under no-tillage compared with conventional tillage. On average, in temperate soils under no-tillage, compared with conventional tillage, CH4 uptake (≈ 0.42 ± 0.10 kg C-CH4·ha -1 ·yr -1

TI  - Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) in lowland springs within an agricultural impacted watershed (Po River Plain, northern Italy)
PY  - 2011
AB  - In the Po River Plain, nitrogen surplus in permeable soils results in elevated downward nitrogen fluxes, mostly as nitrate. Lowland springs, aligned along interfaces between gravel and sandy soils, recycle part of this nitrogen to the surface and we hypothesised that they may be hot spots of N2O and other greenhouse gases, due to incomplete denitrification in the suboxic environment. In early and late summer 2009, water flow was measured and water samples were collected at the outlet and ∼1 km downstream at 14 springs; physico-chemical parameters [temperature, pH, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved gases (O2, N2O, CH4, CO2)] were analysed. All springs were characterised by elevated nitrate concentrations (154–1411 μ M) and recycled to the surface inorganic nitrogen (∼180 kg N on average). Spring waters were suboxic (40–60% of O2 saturation) and CO2, CH4 and N2O supersaturated (26.6–2399.0, 0.002–1.02 and 0.02–1.02 μ M, respectively).

TI  - Towards food, feed and energy crops mitigating climate change.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Agriculture is an important source of anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and crops can affect the microbial processes controlling these emissions in many ways. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of plant–microbe interactions in relation to the CH 4 and N 2 O budgets and show how this is promoting new generations of crop cultivars that have the potential to mitigate GHG emissions for future agricultural use. The possibility of breeding low GHG-emitting cultivars is a paradigm shift towards sustainable agriculture that balances climate change and food and bioenergy security.

TI  - New primers for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of nitrate-reducing bacterial community in soil.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract The narG gene is frequently used as a molecular marker for bacterial nitrate-reducing community analysis. In this study, a new set of primers targeting the narG gene was designed and applied to semi-nested polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) assay. The potential of the new primers was verified on DNA directly extracted from soils from five different experimental sites distributed in Central and Southern Italy. Specificity of the primers was determined by excision, amplification, and sequencing of bands resolved by DGGE. A phylogenetic analysis showed the correlation between the sequences retrieved from the soils studied and the narG sequences from β and γ-Proteobacteria. These primers expanded the existing molecular tools for ecological study on the size and diversity of nitrate-reducing bacterial community in soil.

TI  - Influence of tillage system on denitrification in maize-cropped soils
PY  - 1997
AB  - Denitrification losses show an irregular pattern through the year, often being caused by climatic conditions and management practices. The objectives of the present work were to quantify denitrification losses and to determine the influence of tillage system on the factors that control denitrification in fertilized soils. The modal profile of the soil was an Vertic Argiudoll, clay loam texture, located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The treatments were: (a) fertilized, (b) incorporated fertilization and (c) without fertilization for both no tillage and conventional tillage systems. Chambers were placed in the field to measure denitrification. In this clayish soil the estimated mean values of accumulated denitrification during the crop cycle (90 days) were 0.190kgNha–1 for conventional tillage and 0.350kgNha–1 for no tillage. In treatments with no tillage, losses by denitrification were approximately twice those of conventional tillage. These differences were also evidenced by the number of microorganisms, which were significantly higher (P ;5%) for no tillage on all dates, except for at flowering. The increase at flowering coincided with the period of highest rainfall and consequently the highest water contents in the soil. The highest denitrification losses, except for sowing, were measured when soil moisture content was more than 30% (v/v). Denitrification increased in conjunction with an increase in the availability of carbon that is consumed by the heterotrophic microorganisms (including the denitrifiers).

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from intensive agricultural systems: Variations between crops and seasons, key driving variables, and mean emission factors
PY  - 1999
AB  - Emissions of nitrous oxide from intensively managed agricultural fields were measured over 3 years. Exponential increases in flux occurred with increasing soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and temperature; increases in soil mineral N content due to fertilizer application also stimulated emissions. Fluxes were low when any of these variables was below a critical value. The largest fluxes occurred when WFPS values were very high (70-90%), indicating that denitrification was the major process responsible. The relationships with the driving variables showed strong similarities to those reported for very different environments: irrigated sugar cane crops, pastures, and forest in the tropics. Annual emissions varied widely (0.3-18.4 kg N 2 O-N ha -1 ). These variations were principally due to the degree of coincidence of fertilizer application and major rainfall events. It is concluded therefore that several years' data are required from any agricultural ecosystem in a variable climate to obtain a robust estimate of mean N 2 O fluxes. The emissions from small-grain cereals (winter wheat and spring barley) were consistently lower (0.2-0.7 kg N 2 O-N per 100 kg N applied) than from cut grassland (0.3-5.8 kg N 2 O-N per 100 kg N). Crops such as broccoli and potatoes gave emissions of the same order as those from the grassland. Although these differences between crop types are not apparent in general data comparisons, there may well be distinct regional differences in the relative and absolute emissions from different crops, due to local factors relating to soil type, weather patterns, and agricultural management practices.

TI  - Soil carbon dioxide emission and carbon content as affected by irrigation, tillage, cropping system, and nitrogen fertilization.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Management practices can influence soil CO(2) emission and C content in cropland, which can effect global warming. We examined the effects of combinations of irrigation, tillage, cropping systems, and N fertilization on soil CO(2) flux, temperature, water, and C content at the 0- to 20-cm depth from May to November 2005 at two sites in the northern Great Plains. Treatments were two irrigation systems (irrigated vs. non-irrigated) and six management practices that contained tilled and no-tilled malt barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) with 0 to 134 kg N ha(-1), no-tilled pea (Pisum sativum L.), and a conservation reserve program (CRP) planting applied in Lihen sandy loam (sandy, mixed, frigid, Entic Haplustolls) in western North Dakota. In eastern Montana, treatments were no-tilled malt barley with 78 kg N ha(-1), no-tilled rye (Secale cereale L.), no-tilled Austrian winter pea, no-tilled fallow, and tilled fallow applied in dryland Williams loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls). Irrigation increased CO(2) flux by 13% compared with non-irrigation by increasing soil water content in North Dakota. Tillage increased CO(2) flux by 62 to 118% compared with no-tillage at both places. The flux was 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater with tilled than with non-tilled treatments following heavy rain or irrigation in North Dakota and 1.5- to 2.0-fold greater with crops than with fallow following substantial rain in Montana. Nitrogen fertilization increased CO(2) flux by 14% compared with no N fertilization in North Dakota and cropping increased the flux by 79% compared with fallow in no-till and 0 kg N ha(-1) in Montana. The CO(2) flux in undisturbed CRP was similar to that in no-tilled crops. Although soil C content was not altered, management practices influenced CO(2) flux within a short period due to changes in soil temperature, water, and nutrient contents. Regardless of irrigation, CO(2) flux can be reduced from croplands to a level similar to that in CRP planting using no-tilled crops with or without N fertilization compared with other management practices.

TI  - Long-term effects of tillage systems and rotations on soil structural stability and organic carbon stratification in semiarid central Spain
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Under semiarid Mediterranean climatic conditions, soils typically have low organic matter content and weak structure resulting in low infiltration rates. Aggregate stability is a quality indicator directly related to soil organic matter, which can be redistributed within soil by tillage. Long-term effects (1983–1996) of tillage systems on water stability of pre-wetted and air dried aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC) stratification and crop production were studied in a Vertic Luvisol with a loam texture. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) under winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and vetch ( Vicia sativa L.) rotation (W–V), and under continuous monoculture of winter wheat or winter barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) (CM). Aggregate stability of soil at a depth of 0–5 cm was much greater when 1–2 mm aggregates were vacuum wetted prior to sieving (83%) than when slaked (6%). However, slaking resulted in tillage effects that were consistent with changes in SOC. Aggregate stability of slaked aggregates was greater under ZT than under CT or MT in both crop rotations (i.e., 11% vs. 3%, respectively). SOC under ZT tended to accumulate in the surface soil layer (0–5 and 5–10 cm) at the expense of deeper ones. At depths of 10–20 and 20–30 cm no differences in SOC were encountered among tillage systems, but CT exhibited the highest concentration at 30–40 cm depth. Nevertheless, when comparisons were made on mass basis (Mg ha −1 ), significant differences in stocked SOC were observed at depths of 0–10 and 0–20 cm, where ZT had the highest SOC content in both rotations. The stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm, averaged across crop rotations, was greater under ZT (43 Mg ha −1 ) than under CT (41 Mg ha −1 ) and MT (40 Mg ha −1 ) although these figures were not significantly different. Likewise, no significant differences were encountered in the stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm among crop rotations (i.e., 42 Mg ha −1 for W–V vs. 40 Mg ha −1 for CM). Crop production with wheat–vetch and continuous cereal showed no differences among tillage systems. Yields were strongly limited by the environmental conditions, particularly the amount of rainfall received in the crop growth season and its distribution. Similar yield and improved soil properties under ZT suggests that it is a more sustainable system for the semiarid Mediterranean region of Spain.

TI  - Relationships between farm productivity, profitability, N leaching and GHG emissions: a modelling approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - <jats:p>The financial and environmental performance of a typical dairy and sheep/beef farm under contrasting inputs and systems were modelled to test associations between productivity, profitability, nitrogen (N) leaching and green house gas (GHG) emissions. GHG emissions and N leaching were found to be closely correlated (R2 &gt; 0.90) but the correlation between these two emissions items and production and/or profit was less so, suggesting that systems that are both profitable and have a modest emissions output should be possible. The reasons why farmers have not already adopted these systems are complex but could include any of: requirement of higher level of managerial skill, incompatibility with farm soil type or contour, increased risk and capital cost to convert to the new system. Any system that involves improvements in animal efficiency is associated with a reduction in emissions per kg of saleable product.

TI  - Postharvest nitrous oxide emissions from a subtropical oxisol as influenced by summer crop residues and their management
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas and soil management systems should be evaluated for their N2O mitigation potential. This research evaluated a long-term (22 years) experiment testing the effect of soil management systems on N2O emissions in the postharvest period (autumn) from a subtropical Rhodic Hapludox at the research center FUNDACEP, in Cruz Alta, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Three treatments were evaluated, one under conventional tillage with soybean residues (CTsoybean) and two under no-tillage with soybean (NTsoybean) and maize residues (NTmaize). N2O emissions were measured eight times within 24 days (May 2007) using closed static chambers. Gas flows were obtained based on the relations between gas concentrations in the chamber at regular intervals (0, 15, 30, 45 min) analyzed by gas chromatography. After soybean harvest, accumulated N2O emissions in the period were approximately three times higher in the untilled soil (164 mg m-2 N) than under CT (51 mg m-2 N), with a short-lived N2O peak of 670 mg m-2 h-1 N. In contrast, soil N2O emissions in NT were lower after maize than after soybean, with a N2O peak of 127 g m-2 h-1 N. The multivariate analysis of N2O fluxes and soil variables, which were determined simultaneously with air sampling, demonstrated that the main driving variables of soil N2O emissions were soil microbial activity, temperature, water-filled pore space, and NO3- content. To replace soybean monoculture, crop rotation including maize must be considered as a strategy to decrease soil N2O emissions from NT soils in Southern Brazil in a Autumn.

TI  - Soil aggregates control N cycling efficiency in long-term conventional and alternative cropping systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper presents novel data illustrating how soil aggregates control nitrogen (N) dynamics within conventional and alternative Mediterranean cropping systems. An experiment with 15N-labeled cover crop residue and synthetic fertilizer was conducted in long-term (11 years) maize–tomato rotations: conventional (synthetic N only), low-input (reduced synthetic and cover crop-N), and organic (composted manure- and cover crop-N). Soil and nitrous oxide (N2O) samples were collected throughout the maize growing season. Soil samples were separated into three aggregate size classes. We observed a trend of shorter mean residence times in the silt-and-clay fraction than macro- (>250 μm) and microaggregate fractions (53–250 μm). The majority of synthetic fertilizer-derived 15N in the conventional system was associated with the silt-and-clay fraction (<53 μm), which showed shorter mean residence times (2.6 months) than cover crop-derived 15N in the silt-and-clay fractions in the low-input (14.5 months) and organic systems (18.3 months). This, combined with greater N2O fluxes and low fertilizer-N recoveries in both the soil and the crop, suggest that rapid aggregate-N turnover induced greater N losses and reduced the retention of synthetic fertilizer-N in the conventional system. The organic system, which received 11 years of organic amendments, sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil N, whereas the conventional and low-input systems merely maintained SOC and soil N levels. Nevertheless, the low-input system showed the highest yield per unit of N applied. Our data suggests that the alternating application of cover crop-N and synthetic fertilizer-N in the low-input system accelerates aggregate-N turnover in comparison to the organic system, thereby, leading to tradeoffs among N loss, benefits of organic amendments to SOC and soil N sequestration, and N availability for plant uptake.

TI  - Effects of irrigation, fertilization and crop straw management on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from a wheat–maize rotation field in northern China
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract One-year winter wheat–summer maize rotation is the most popular double cropping system in north-central China, and this highly productive system is an important source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to the high fertilizer N and irrigation water inputs. To sustain the high crop production and mitigate the detrimental impacts of N 2 O and NO emissions, improved management practices are extensively applied. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effects of an improved management practice of irrigation, fertilization and crop straw on grain yield and N 2 O and NO emissions for a wheat–maize rotation field in northern China. Using automated and manual chamber measuring systems, we monitored N 2 O and NO fluxes for the conventional (CT, 2007–2008), improved (IT, 2007–2008), straw-amended (WS, 2008–2009), straw-not-amended (NS, 2008–2009), and no N-fertilizer treatments (WS–NN, 2008–2009), respectively, for one rotation-year. The grain yields were determined for CT and IT for three rotation-years (2005–2008) and for WS, NS and WS–NN for one rotation-year (2008–2009). The improved management of irrigation and fertilization reduced the annual N fertilization rate and irrigation amount by 17% and 30%, respectively; increased the maize yield by 7–14%; and significantly decreased the N 2 O and NO emissions by 7% ( p p 2 O and NO emissions in the following maize season by 58% ( p 2 O and NO emission factors of applied N were 2.32 ± 2.32% and 0.42 ± 1.69% for wheat straw and 0.67 ± 0.23% and 0.54 ± 0.15% for chemical N-fertilizers, respectively. Compared to conventional management practices using high application rates of irrigation water and chemical N-fertilizer as well as the field burning of crop straw, the improved management strategy presented here has obvious environmentally positive effects on grain yield and mitigation of N 2 O and NO emissions.

TI  - Tillage-induced changes to soil structure and organic carbon fractions in New Zealand soils
PY  - 2001
AB  - The effects of increasing cropping and soil compaction on aggregate stability and dry-sieved aggregate-size distribution, and their relationship to total organic C (TOC) and the major functional groups of soil organic carbon, were investigated on 5 soils of contrasting mineralogy. All soils except the allophanic soil showed a significant decline in aggregate stability under medium- to long-term cropping. Mica-rich, fine-textured mineral and humic soils showed the greatest increase in the mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregates, while the oxide-rich soils, and particularly the allophanic soils, showed only a slight increase in the MWD after long-term cropping. On conversion back to pasture, the aggregate stability of the mica-rich soils increased and the MWD of the aggregate-size distribution decreased, with the humic soil showing the greatest recovery. Aggregate stability and dry aggregate-size distribution patterns show that soil resistance to structural degradation and soil resilience increased from fine-textured to coarse-textured to humic mica-rich soils to oxide-rich soils to allophanic soils. Coarse- and fine-textured mica-rich and oxide-rich soils under pasture contained medium amounts of TOC, hot-water soluble carbohydrate (WSC), and acid hydrolysable carbohydrate (AHC), all of which declined significantly under cropping. The rate of decline varied with soil type in the initial years of cropping, but was similar under medium- and long-term cropping. TOC was high in the humic mica-rich and allophanic soils, and levels did not decline appreciably under medium- and long-term cropping. 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance evidence also indicates that all major functional groups of soil organic carbon declined under cropping, with O-alkyl C and alkyl C showing the fastest and slowest rate of decline, respectively. On conversion back to pasture, both WSC and AHC returned to levels originally present under long-term pasture. TOC recovered to original pasture levels in the humic soil, but recovered only to 60–70% of original levels in the coarse- and fine-textured soils. Aggregate stability was strongly correlated to TOC, WSC, and AHC (P < 0.001), while aggregate-size distribution was moderately correlated to aggregate stability (P < 0.01) and weakly correlated to AHC (P < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy indicated a loss of the binding agents around aggregates under cropping. The effect of the loss of these binding agents on soil structure was more pronounced in mica-rich soils than in oxide-rich and allophanic soils. The very high aggregate stabilities of the humic soil under pasture was attributed to the presence of a protective water-repellent lattice of long-chain polymethylene compounds around the soil aggregates.

TI  - Implications of climate change for grassland in Europe: impacts, adaptations and mitigation options: a review
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary
Climate change associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may have important implications for Europe's grasslands. Projected scenarios indicate that increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations have the potential to increase herbage growth and to favour legumes more than grasses, but changes in seasonal precipitation would reduce these benefits particularly in areas with low summer rainfall. Further implications for grasslands may arise from increased frequency of droughts, storms and other extreme events. Potential farm-scale adaptive responses to climate change are identified. Grassland agriculture also contributes to GHG emissions, particularly methane and nitrous oxide, and management of grassland affects net carbon balances and carbon sequestration. Management options are identified for mitigating grassland's contribution to GHG emissions which need to be developed in a holistic way that also considers other pressures.

TI  - Comparison through a LCA evaluation analysis of food waste disposal options from the perspective of global warming and resource recovery.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract This study evaluated feed manufacturing including dry feeding and wet feeding, composting, and landfilling for food waste disposal options from the perspective of global warming and resource recovery. The method of the expanded system boundaries was employed in order to compare different by-products. The whole stages of disposal involved in the systems such as separate discharge, collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal, were included in the system boundary and evaluated. The Global Warming Potential generated from 1 tonne of food wastes for each disposal system was analyzed by the life cycle assessment method. The results showed that 200 kg of CO2-eq could be produced from dry feeding process, 61 kg of CO2-eq from wet feeding process, 123 kg of CO2-eq from composting process, and 1010 kg of CO2-eq from landfilling. Feed manufacturing and composting, the common treatment methods currently employed, have been known to be environment friendlier than other methods. However, this study shows that they can negatively affect the environment if their by-products are not appropriately utilized as intended.

TI  - Biodiesel production in a semiarid environment: a life cycle assessment approach.
PY  - 2011
AB  - While the use of biodiesel appears to be a promising alternative to petroleum fuel, the replacement of fossil fuel by biofuel may not bring about the intended climate cooling because of the increased soil N2O emissions due to N-fertilizer applications. Using a life cycle assessment approach, we assessed the influence of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions on the life cycle global warming potential of the production and combustion of biodiesel from canola oil produced in a semiarid climate. Utilizing locally measured soil N2O emissions, rather than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default values, decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production and combustion of 1 GJ biodiesel from 63 to 37 carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e)/GJ. GHG were 1.1 to 2.1 times lower than those from petroleum or petroleum-based diesel depending on which soil N2O emission factors were included in the analysis. The advantages of utilizing biodiesel rapidly declined when blended with petroleum diesel. Mitigation strategies that decrease emissions from the production and application of N fertilizers may further decrease the life cycle GHG emissions in the production and combustion of biodiesel.

TI  - Nitrogen, Tillage, and Crop Rotation Effects on Carbon Dioxide and Methane Fluxes from Irrigated Cropping Systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Long-term effects of tillage intensity, N fertilization, and crop rotation on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) flux from semiarid irrigated soils are poorly understood. We evaluated effects of; (i) tillage intensity [no-till (NT) and conventional moldboard plow tillage (CT)] in a continuous corn rotation; (ii) N fertilization levels [0-246 kg N ha -1 for corn (Zea mays L.); 0 and 56 kg N ha -1 for dry bean (Phasealus vulgaris L.); 0 and 112 kg N ha -1 for barley (Hordeum distichon L.)]; and (iii) crop rotation under NT soil management [corn-barley (NT-CB); continuous corn (NT-CC); corn-dry bean (NT-CDb)] on CO 2 and CH 4 flux from a clay loam soil. Carbon dioxide and CH 4 fluxes were monitored one to three times per week using vented nonsteady state closed chambers. No-till reduced (14%) growing season (154 d) cumulative CO 2 emissions relative to CT (NT: 2.08 Mg CO 2 -C ha -1 ; CT: 2.41 Mg CO 2 -C ha -1 ), while N fertilization had no effect. Significantly lower (18%) growing season CO 2 fluxes were found in NT-CDb than NT-CC and NT-CB (11.4, 13.2 and 13.9 kg CO 2 -C ha -1 d -1 respectively). Growing season CH 4 emissions were higher in NT (20.2 g CH 4 ha -1 ) than in CT (1.2 g CH 4 ha -1 ). Nitrogen fertilization and cropping rotation did not affect CH 4 flux. Implementation of NT for 7 yr with no N fertilization was not adequate for restoring the CH 4 oxidation capacity of this clay loam soil relative to CT plowed and fertilized soil.

TI  - Conservation tillage.
PY  - 1985
AB  - Conservation production systems combine tillage and planting practices to reduce soil erosion and loss of water from farmland. Successful conservation tillage practices depend on the ability of farm managers to integrate sound crop production practices with effective pest management systems. More scientific information is needed to determine the relations between tillage practices and physical, chemical, and biological soil factors that affect plant and pest ecology. There is a need to devise improved pest management strategies for conservation tillage and to better understand the impact of conservation tillage on water-quality, especially as it is related to use of agricultural chemicals. While savings in fuel, labor, and soil have induced many farmers to adopt conservation tillage, improved methods and equipment should increase adoption even more.

TI  - Tillage effects on carbon fluxes in continuous wheat and fallow-wheat rotations.
PY  - 2000
AB  - The traditional cropping system in semiarid regions of the Canadian prairies involves frequent summer fallowing with several tillage operations to control weeds during the fallow period. Recently, there has been a trend toward reduced tillage and more intensive cropping, but the impact of this shift in management on sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 remains uncertain. In 1995 and 1996, we measured fluxes of CO 2 in a tillage experiment that had been initiated in 1982 on a silt loam (Typic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan. The experiment comprised two spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations (continuous wheat [Cont. W] and fallow-wheat [F-W]), each with conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) treatments. In Cont. W, CO 2 fluxes tended to be lower under NT than under CT (mean annual flux was 20 to 25% less for NT than CT). In F-W, tillage effects on mean annual CO 2 flux were significant (P < 0.05) in the wheat phase only (NT 10% less than CT). Tillage had negligible effect on C inputs in crop residues. lower CO 2 fluxes under NT than under CT were attributed to slower decomposition of crop residues placed on the surface of NT soil than when they were incorporated. With good growing conditions (and thus large inputs of residues) between 1989 and 1996, there was an accumulation of partially decomposed residues on the surface of NT soil. Carbon in surface residues represented about one-half of the C gained by NT soil. In Cont. W, surface residue C (in 1996) amounted to 3.6 t ha -1 under NT vs 1.4 t ha -1 under CT. Residue C amounts were smaller in the F-W system: 1.7 t ha -1 (NT) and 0.7 t ha -1 (CT). Based on our results, producers on medium-textured soils in the semiarid Canadian prairies who switch from the traditional wheat production system (conventionally tilled fallow-wheat) to continuous no-till cropping could, potentially, sequester 5 to 6 t C ha -1 in soil organic matter and surface residues in 13 to 14 yr.

TI  - Atmospheric inversions for estimating CO2 fluxes: methods and perspectives
PY  - 2010
AB  - We provide a review description of atmospheric inversion methods for the determination of fluxes of long-lived trace gases based on measurements of atmospheric concentration. Emphasis is given to technical aspects of inversion settings, which are crucial to inter-compare and understand inversion results. We briefly sketch the formalism used in such methods, then provide a summary of major currents in research and contemporary problems. Most attention is given to carbon dioxide (CO2) which poses the threat of future climate change. Therefore, there is keen interest in better understanding where and when CO2 emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels is reabsorbed by land ecosystems and oceans. Using the information contained in concentration fields observed from ground-based networks and from upcoming satellite observations in order to constrain the geographic distribution of surface fluxes is an inverse problem; it consists of finding a set of fluxes that optimally matches the observations available. We review the application of inverse methods to quantify the distribution of the sources and sinks of CO2 at the surface of the Earth based on global measurements of atmospheric concentration and three-dimensional models of atmospheric transport. We describe the use of top–down atmospheric inversion methods in terms of numerical transport modeling and atmospheric observation networks, and detail some of the currently important issues in assigning uncertainties.

TI  - Implications of the carbon cycle steady state assumption for biogeochemical modeling performance and inverse parameter retrieval
PY  - 2008
AB  - We analyze the impacts of the steady state assumption on inverse model parameter retrieval from biogeochemical models. An inverse model parameterization study using eddy covariance CO 2 flux data was performed with the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model under conditions of strict and relaxed carbon cycle steady state assumption (CCSSA) in order to evaluate both the robustness of the model's structure for the simulation of net ecosystem carbon fluxes and the assessment of the CCSSA effects on simulations and parameter estimation. Net ecosystem production (NEP) measurements from several eddy covariance sites were compared with NEP estimates from the CASA model driven by local weather station climate inputs as well as by remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation and leaf area index. The parameters considered for optimization are directly related to aboveground and belowground modeled responses to temperature and water availability, as well as a parameter (η) that relaxed the CCSSA in the model, allowing for site level simulations to be initialized either as net sinks or sources. A robust relationship was observed between NEP observations and predictions for most of the sites through the range of temporal scales considered (daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly), supporting the conclusion that the model structure is able to capture the main processes explaining NEP variability. Overall, relaxing CCSSA increased model efficiency (21%) and decreased normalized average error (-92%). Intersite variability was a major source of variance in model performance differences between fixed (CCSSA f ) and relaxed (CCSSA r ) CCSSA conditions. These differences were correlated with mean annual NEP observations, where an average increase in modeling efficiency of 0.06 per 100 g Cm -2 a -1 (where a is years) of NEP is observed (α < 0.003). The parameter η was found to be a key parameter in the optimization exercise, generating significant model efficiency losses when removed from the initial parameter set and parameter uncertainties were significantly lower under CCSSA r . Moreover, modeled soil carbon stocks were generally closer to observations once the steady state assumption was relaxed. Finally, we also show that estimates of individual parameters are affected by the steady state assumption. For example, estimates of radiation-use efficiency were strongly affected by the CCSSA f indicating compensation effects for the inadequate steady state assumption, leading to effective and thus biased parameters. Overall, the importance of model structural evaluation in data assimilation approaches is thus emphasized.

TI  - Water infiltration and soil structure related to organic matter and its stratification with depth
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Soil organic matter is a key attribute of soil quality that impacts soil aggregation and water infiltration. Two soils (Typic Kanhapludults), one under long-term management of conventional tillage (CT) and one under long-term management of no tillage (NT), were sampled to a depth of 12 cm. Soil cores (15 cm diameter) were either left intact or sieved and repacked to differentiate between short-term (sieving) and long-term (tillage management) effects of soil disturbance on water infiltration, penetration resistance, soil bulk density, macroaggregate stability, and soil organic carbon (SOC). Mean weekly water infiltration was not different between sieved and intact cores from long-term CT (22 cm h −1 ), but was significantly greater in intact (72 cm h −1 ) than in sieved (28 cm h −1 ) soil from long-term NT. The stratification ratio of SOC (i.e., of 0–3 cm depth divided by that of 6–12 cm depth) was predictive of water infiltration rate, irrespective of short- or long-term history of disturbance. Although tillage is used to increase soil porosity, it is a short-term solution that has negative consequences on surface soil structural stability, surface residue accumulation, and surface-SOC, which are critical features that control water infiltration and subsequent water transmission and storage in soil. The stratification ratio of SOC could be used as a simple diagnostic tool to identify land management strategies that improve soil water properties (e.g., infiltration, water-holding capacity, and plant-available water).

TI  - Potential rates and environmental controls of denitrification and nitrous oxide production in a temperate urbanized estuary
PY  - 2010
AB  - Denitrification may play a major role in inorganic nitrogen removal from estuarine ecosystems, particularly in those subjected to increased nitrate and organic matter loads. The Douro estuary (NW Portugal) suffers from both problems: freshwater input of nitrate and organic load from untreated wastewater discharges. To assess how these factors might control sediment denitrification, a 12-month survey was designed. Denitrification potential and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) production were measured at different locations using the slurry acetylene blockage technique. Denitrification rate ranged from 0.4 to 38 nmol N g⁻¹ h⁻¹, increasing towards the river mouth following an urban pollution gradient. N(2)O production, a powerful greenhouse gas implicated on the destruction of the ozone layer, was significantly related with sediment organic matter and accounted for 0.5-47% of the N gases produced. Additional enrichment experiments were consistent with the results found in the environment, showing that sediments from the upper less urban stretch of the estuary, mostly sandy, respond positively to carbon and, inversely, in organic rich sediments from the lower estuary, the denitrification potential was limited by nitrate availability. The obtained results confirmed denitrification as an important process for the removal of nitrate in estuaries. The presence of wastewater discharges appears to stimulate nitrogen removal but also the production of N(2)O, a powerful greenhouse gas, exacerbating the N(2)O:N(2) ratio and thus should be controlled.

TI  - Methane yields from Brahman cattle fed tropical grasses and legumes
PY  - 2012
AB  - In the national greenhouse inventory, methane emissions from the Australian tropical beef herd are derived from cattle fed two diets. In the experiments reported here, methane production was measured by open-circuit gas exchange from 13 Brahman cattle offered 22 diets from combinations of five tropical grass species and five legumes, with a minimum of three steers per diet. All diets were offered daily ad libitum, with the exception of three legume diets fed without grass and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) mixed with grass, which were offered at 15 g dry matter per kg liveweight. Diets were fed as long-chopped dried hay, with the exception of leucaena, which was harvested and fed within 2 days. For the data from cattle fed diets of grass and grass mixed with legumes, methane production could be predicted as 19.6 g/kg forage dry matter intake (residual standard deviation 12.3). Observed methane yields were not predictable from a stoichiometry, which used volatile fatty acid proportions in rumen fluid. Mean methane emission rates across all diets were equivalent to 8.6–13.4% of digestible energy intake, and 5.0–7.2% of gross energy intake. The latter values are comparable to IPCC (2006) recommendations (5.5–7.5%) for large ruminants fed low-quality crop residues and by-products. Methane yields per unit of ingested dry matter or digested organic matter were variable across diets but were related to digestibility and contents of fibre and protein. These results constitute a significant downward revision of the methane emissions attributable to the northern Australian beef herd grazing tropical pastures.

TI  - The impact of agricultural soil erosion on the global carbon cycle
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural soil erosion is thought to perturb the global carbon cycle, but estimates of its effect range from a source of 1 petagram per year(-1) to a sink of the same magnitude. By using caesium-137 and carbon inventory measurements from a large-scale survey, we found consistent evidence for an erosion-induced sink of atmospheric carbon equivalent to approximately 26% of the carbon transported by erosion. Based on this relationship, we estimated a global carbon sink of 0.12 (range 0.06 to 0.27) petagrams of carbon per year(-1) resulting from erosion in the world's agricultural landscapes. Our analysis directly challenges the view that agricultural erosion represents an important source or sink for atmospheric CO2.

TI  - A Conceptual Model of Changes in Soil Structure Under Different Cropping Systems
PY  - 1988
AB  - There is much evidence that soil structure can be markedly affected by a farmer’s choice of cropping systems. For example, tillage type and intensity may substantially influence soil structure (for reviews see Cannell, 1985; Davies et al., 1982; R.S. Russell, 1977). The choice of crop may also result in significant alterations to soil structure. Many researchers have found deteriorations in soil structure under arable crops such as corn (Zea mays) (Page and Willard, 1946), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) (Doyle and Hamlyn, 1960), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) (Low, 1972). Improvements in soil structure have been observed under a number of ley and pasture grasses (see e.g., A.L. Clarke et al., 1967; Robinson and Jacques, 1958) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (Cooke and Williams, 1972). Figure 1 illustrates some measured changes in soil structure which can be attributed to different cropping systems. Harris et al. (1966) and E.W. Russell (1973) summarized much of the earlier research in this area.

TI  - Recycling of sewage sludge and household compost to arable land: fate and effects of organic contaminants, and impact on soil fertility
PY  - 2003
AB  - Effective use of organic wastes for agricultural production requires that risks and benefits be documented. Two types of sewage sludge, household compost and solid pig manure were studied under field and greenhouse conditions to describe their fertilizer value and effects on soil properties and soil biota, the fate of selected organic contaminants, and their potential for plant uptake. A 3-year field trial on two soil types showed no adverse effects of waste amendment on crop growth, and a significant fertilizer value of one sludge type. Accumulation of N and Pi was indicated, as well as some stimulation of biological activity and micro-arthropod populations, but these effects differed between soil types. There was no detectable accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenol and ethoxylates (NP+NPE) or linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) after three repeated waste applications, and no plant uptake was suggested by analysis of the third crop. A plot experiment with banded sludge was conducted to examine sludge turnover and toxicity in detail. Less than 5% of NP or LAS applied in organic wastes was recovered after 6 months, and less than 6% of DEHP applied was recovered after 12 months. Potential ammonium oxidation (PAO) at 0–1 cm distance from the banded sludge was stimulated despite toxic concentrations in the sludge, which suggested that contaminants were degraded inside sludge particles. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles suggested a gradual shift in the composition of the microbial community within sludge, partly due to a depletion of degradable substrates. A pot experiment with sludge-amended soil and soil spiked with contaminants showed no plant uptake of NP, DEHP or LAS. Degradation of LAS and NP added in sludge was delayed and the degradation of DEHP was faster than when the contaminants were added directly to the soil. In conclusion, adverse effects of organic waste application on soil or crop were not found in this study, and for some waste products positive effects were observed.

TI  - Use of an inverse dispersion technique for estimating ammonia emission from surface-applied slurry.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Ammonia (NH 3 ) emission from land application of manure is typically measured using the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) micrometeorological method. However, there are some situations in which alternative techniques (such as an inverse dispersion modelling technique) might be preferable, for example when measuring from large or irregularly shaped source areas. In this study, an inverse dispersion technique using the backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) model, with 2 different experimental configurations, was compared with the Integrated Horizontal Flux method (i.e. IHF), which was used as reference technique. Pig slurry was surface-applied at 125 kg N ha −1 to bare soil on a large plot (80 × 125 m). Cumulative emissions were 19.3, 21.2 and 18.4 kg N ha −1 from the IHF and the bLS technique (experimental configurations I and II), respectively. Mean flux within each sampling period as estimated by the two techniques compared extremely well, with a slope not significantly different from 1 and r 2 of 0.99. Although limited in extent, this dataset agree with a previous study in demonstrating the use of the bLS technique with longer period time-averaged concentration measurements.

TI  - Chemical and biochemical properties in a silty loam soil under conventional and organic management
PY  - 2005
AB  - To improve soil fertility, efforts need to be made to increase soil organic matter content. Conventional farming practice generally leads to a reduction of soil organic matter. This study compared inorganic and organic fertilisers in a crop rotation system over two cultivation cycles: first crop broad bean (Vicia faba L.) and second crop mixed cropped melon-water melon (Cucumis melo-Citrullus vulgaris) under semi-arid conditions. Total organic carbon (TOC), Kjeldahl-N, available-P, microbial biomass C (Cmic), and N (Nmic), soil respiration and enzymatic activities (protease, urease, and alkaline phosphatase) were determined in soils between the fourth and sixth year of management comparison. The metabolic quotient (qCO2), the Cmic/Nmic ratio, and the Cmic/TOC ratio were also calculated. Organic management resulted in significant increases in TOC and Kjeldahl-N, available-P, soil respiration, microbial biomass, and enzymatic activities compared with those found under conventional management. Crop yield was greater from organic than conventional fertilizer. The qCO2 showed a progressive increase for both treatments during the study, although qCO2 was greater with conventional than organic fertilizer. In both treatments, an increase in the Cmic/Nmic ratio from first to second crop cycle was observed, indicating a change in the microbial populations. Biochemical properties were positively correlated (p < 0.01) with TOC and nutrient content. These results indicated that organic management positively affected soil organic matter content, thus improving soil quality and productivity.

TI  - The myth of nitrogen fertilization for soil carbon sequestration.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Intensive use of N fertilizers in modern agriculture is motivated by the economic value of high grain yields and is generally perceived to sequester soil organic C by increasing the input of crop residues. This perception is at odds with a century of soil organic C data reported herein for the Morrow Plots, the world's oldest experimental site under continuous corn (Zea mays L.). After 40 to 50 yr of synthetic fertilization that exceeded grain N removal by 60 to 190%, a net decline occurred in soil C despite increasingly massive residue C incorporation, the decline being more extensive for a corn-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) or corn-oats (Avena sativa L.)-hay rotation than for continuous corn and of greater intensity for the profile (0-46 cm) than the surface soil. These findings implicate fertilizer N in promoting the decomposition of crop residues and soil organic matter and are consistent with data from numerous cropping experiments involving synthetic N fertilization in the USA Corn Belt and elsewhere, although not with the interpretation usually provided. There are important implications for soil C sequestration because the yield-based input of fertilizer N has commonly exceeded grain N removal for corn production on fertile soils since the 1960s. To mitigate the ongoing consequences of soil deterioration, atmospheric CO(2) enrichment, and NO(3)(-) pollution of ground and surface waters, N fertilization should be managed by site-specific assessment of soil N availability. Current fertilizer N management practices, if combined with corn stover removal for bioenergy production, exacerbate soil C loss.

TI  - Nitrous oxide evolution from irrigated land.
PY  - 1980
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N/sub 2/O) fluxes from irrigated land cropped to vegetables in a coastal valley in California ranged from 0.0038 to 1.06 kg N/ha per day. For all sites, maximum fluxes (0.24 to 1.06 kg N/ha per day) were observed during the first post-fertilization irrigation and were followed by a trend to lower values (0.048 to 0.144 kg N/ha per day) towards the end of cropping despite total fertilizer N inputs of 176 to 528 kg N/ha. The N/sub 2/O flux showed a pronounced dependence on irrigation events with maximum fluxes associated with soil-moisture contents between 18 and 22% and soil-water suctions between 75 and 150 mbars. The magnitude of N/sub 2/O flux during periods of high moisture content appeared to depend primarily upon soil nitrate concentration which declined during the cropping cycle. Data for N/sub 2/O flux, soil moisture content, air-filled porosity, and soil-water suction suggested that denitrification rather than nitrification was the major process involved in N/sub 2/O production at each field site. Mean N/sub 2/O fluxes for each site coupled with soil-water suction data for a 12-month period suggested annual emissions of N/sub 2/O ranging from 19.6 to 41.8 kg N/ha.

TI  - Soil organic matter pools with conventional and zero tillage in a cold, semiarid climate
PY  - 1996
AB  - Conservation of soil organic matter (SOM), especially in high-SOM surface soils of the Canadian Prairies, is essential for maintaining soil quality and regulating soil CO2 emissions. We determined the depth distribution (0–50, 50–125, and 125–200 mm) of soil organic C (SOC), soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), basal soil respiration (BSR), and net N mineralization in four Boralfs subjected to shallow conventional tillage (CT) and zero tillage (ZT). Tillage regimes were initiated 4, 4, 7, and 16 years prior to these measurements on a limed clay loam, unlimed clay loam, loam, and silt loam, respectively, located in northern Alberta and British Columbia. Soils under ZT were an average of 4% denser and 24% wetter than under CT. SOC content to a depth of 200 mm was 6.5 kg m−2 under CT and 11% greater under ZT in the limed clay loam, but not different between tillage regimes in the unlimed clay loam (7.1 kg m−2), silt loam (5.1 kg m−2), and loam (4.3 kg m−2). BSR averaged 4.0 and 3.1 g CO2-C per square meter per day under CT and ZT, respectively. The portions of SOC and SMBC as BSR under ZT were lower than under CT. However, net N mineralization averaged 3.4 and 4.1 g m−2 per 24 days under CT and ZT, respectively. The cold, semiarid climate of the Canadian Prairies appears to have hindered any acceleration of decomposition of SOM and crop residues owing to soil disturbance with CT. Therefore, SOC and active soil C pools were not enriched by minimized soil disturbance, unlike results obtained from more temperate and humid climates.

TI  - Long-term tillage effects on soil carbon storage and carbon dioxide emissions in continuous corn cropping system from an alfisol in Ohio.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The experiment designed to quantify the effects of long-term tillage practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and CO2 emissions, was conducted on long-term tillage and continuous corn (Zea mays L.). The experimental plots were established in 1962 on a Crosby silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf) in Ohio. It consisted of moldboard plow till (MT) chisel till (CT), and no-till (NT) laid out in a randomized block design with four replications. After 43 yrs of continuous corn, the pool of SOC in the top 30 cm depth was significantly greater under NT (80.0 ± 3.7 Mg C ha−1) than under CT (45.3 ± 1.7 Mg C ha−1) and MT (44.8 ± 3.7 Mg C ha−1). A large proportion (68–74%) of SOC, in the 0–30 cm depth originated from corn residues (C4-C). On average, MT, CT and NT treatments sequestered C4-C in the top 30 cm at a rate of 0.73, 0.71 and 1.37 Mg ha−1 yr−1. The average daily CO2 fluxes (g CO2-C m−2 d−1) were greater under MT (2.14) and CT (2.07) than under NT (1.61). In addition, the daily CO2 fluxes were highest in summer (2.62–3.77 g CO2-C m−2 d−1), the lowest in winter (0.75–0.87 g CO2-C m−2 d−1), and were positively correlated with air (R2 = 0.78, P < 0.01) and soil temperatures in the top 20 cm (R2 = 0.76, P < 0.01) and negatively with soil water content (R2 = 0.57, P < 0.05). Tillage management had a significant influence on average daily CO2 fluxes during summer and autumn but not during winter and spring. Annual CO2 emissions calculated by extrapolating daily CO2 fluxes were significantly higher under MT (6.6 ± 0.3 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1) and CT (6.2 ± 0.4 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1) than under NT (5.5 ± 0.5 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1; LSD = 0.25 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1). These results indicated that, during the growing season, NT reduced CO2 emissions by an average of 0.7 and 0.6 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 compared to MT and CT, respectively.

TI  - Soil CO2 flux from a norfolk loamy sand after 25 years of conventional and conservation tillage
PY  - 2005
AB  - Tillage affects the ability of coarse-textured soils of the southeastern USA to sequester C. Our objectives were to compare tillage methods for soil CO2 flux, and determine if chemical or physical properties after 25 years of conventional or conservation tillage correlated with flux rates. Data were collected for several weeks during June and July in 2003, October and November in 2003, and April to July in 2004 from a tillage study established in 1978 on a Norfolk loamy sand (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudults). Conventional tillage consisted of disking to a depth of approximately 15 cm followed by smoothing with an S-tined harrow equipped with rolling baskets. Conservation tillage consisted of direct seeding into surface residues. Flux rates in conservation tillage averaged 0.84 g CO2 m � 2 h � 1 in Summer 2003, 0.36 g CO2 m � 2 h � 1 in Fall 2003, 0.46 g CO2 m � 2 h � 1 in Spring 2004, and 0.86 g CO2 m � 2 h � 1 in Summer 2004. Flux rates from conventional tillage were greater for most measurement times. Conversely, water content of the surface soil layer (6.5 cm) was almost always higher with conservation tillage. Soil CO2 flux was highly correlated with soil water content only in conventional tillage. In conservation tillage, no significant correlations occurred between soil CO2 flux and soil N, C, C:N ratio, pH, bulk density, sand fraction, or clay fraction of the surface 7.5 cm. In conventional tillage, sand fraction was positively correlated, while bulk density and clay fraction were negatively correlated with soil CO2 flux rate, but only when the soil was moist. Long-term conservation tillage management resulted in more uniform withinand across-season soil CO2 flux rates that were less affected by precipitation events. # 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments, conducted during 2006 and 2007, were laid out in a split plot design with four replicates, two main plots (organic and conventional system) and two sub-plots (cotton varieties: Athena and Campo). There were no significant differences between the organic and conventional system for cotton growth, yield and fiber quality.

Inferior-quality fiber was produced in the variety. Campo, which had the lowest fiber fineness (micronaire), strength, length and reflection. In addition, this variety had the highest fiber elongation and yellowness. There were no significant differences between varieties as far as uniformity and leaf trash ratio are concerned. A positive correlation was observed between fiber strength and length. However, a negative correlation was found between lint yield and fiber strength.</jats:p>

TI  - The origin, composition and rates of organic nitrogen deposition: A missing piece of the nitrogen cycle?
PY  - 2002
AB  - Organic forms of nitrogen are widespread in the atmosphere and their deposition may constitute a substantive input of atmospheric N to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies have expanded the pool of available measurements and our awareness of their potential significance. Here, we use these measurements to provide a coherent picture of the processes that produce both oxidized and reduced forms of organic nitrogen in the atmosphere, examine how those processes are linked to human activity and how they may contribute to the N load from the atmosphere to ecosystems. We summarize and synthesize data from 41 measurements of the concentrations and fluxes of atmospheric organic nitrogen (AON). In addition, we examine the contribution of reduced organic nitrogen compounds such as amino acids, bacterial/particulate N, and oxidized compounds such as organic nitrates to deposition fluxes of AON. The percentage contribution of organic N to total N loading varies from site to site and with measurement methodology but is consistently around a third of the total N load with a median value of 30% (Standard Deviation of 16%). There are no indications that AON is a proportionally greater contributor to N deposition in unpolluted environments and there are not strong correlations between fluxes of nitrate and AON or ammonium and AON. Possible sources for AON include byproducts of reactions between NOx and hydrocarbons, marine and terrestrial sources of reduced (amino acid) N and the long-range transport of organic matter (dust, pollen etc.) and bacteria. Both dust and organic nitrates such as PAN appear to play an important role in the overall flux of AON to the surface of the earth. For estimates of organic nitrate deposition, we also use an atmospheric chemical transport model to evaluate the spatial distribution of fluxes and the globally integrated deposition values. Our preliminary estimate of the magnitude of global AON fluxes places the flux between 10 and 50 Tg of N per year with substantial unresolved uncertainties but clear indications that AON deposition is an important aspect of local and global atmospheric N budgets and deserves further consideration.

AB  - Abstract Published reports of CH4 yields as g CH4/kg dry matter (DM) intake suggest that emissions from sheep fed fresh forage chicory (Cichorium intybus) are about 30% lower than from those fed fresh ryegrass. In this study, 2 year old wethers (16; 54 ± 3.8 kg liveweight) were fed either mature chicory or perennial ryegrass at 1.3 times maintenance metabolisable energy requirements in the late spring/early summer of 2009. Methane emissions were determined using individual animal respiration chambers. Feeds differed in their chemical composition with chicory containing 856 g/kg organic matter (OM), 117 g/kg crude protein (CP) and 281 g/kg neutral detergent fibre (aNDF), whereas ryegrass contained 916 g/kg OM, 85 g/kg CP and 499 g/kg aNDF. The DM intake was similar for both forages at 0.76 kg/d, and CH4 yields did not differ between forages being 22.8 and 23.8 g CH4/kg DM intake for chicory and ryegrass, respectively. In vitro incubations of chicory and perennial ryegrass in the vegetative or mature states had similar CH4 yields. Despite large differences in chemical composition, especially aNDF, chicory and ryegrass had similar CH4 yields in vitro and in vivo. Chicory is not a viable alternative to perennial ryegrass for mitigating CH4 in pastoral based sheep production systems.

TI  - Initial nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and methane costs of converting conservation reserve program grassland to row crops under no-till vs. conventional tillage.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Around 4.4 million ha of land in USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contracts will expire between 2013 and 2018 and some will likely return to crop production. No-till (NT) management offers the potential to reduce the global warming costs of CO2 ,C H4, and N2O emissions during CRP conversion, but to date there have been no CRP conversion tillage comparisons. In 2009, we converted portions of three 9–21 ha CRP fields in Michigan to conventional tillage (CT) or NT soybean production and reserved a fourth field for reference. Both CO2 and N2O fluxes increased following herbicide application in all converted fields, but in the CT treatment substantial and immediate N2O and CO2 fluxes occurred after tillage. For the initial 201-day conversion period, average daily N2O fluxes (g N2ONh a � 1 d � 1 ) were significantly different in the order: CT (47.5 � 6.31, n = 6) ≫ NT (16.7 � 2.45, n = 6) ≫ reference (2.51 � 0.73, n = 4). Similarly, soil CO2 fluxes in CT were 1.2 times those in NT and 3.1 times those in the unconverted CRP reference field. All treatments were minor sinks for CH4 (� 0.69 � 0.42 to � 1.86 � 0.37 g CH4– Ch a � 1 d � 1 ) with no significant differences among treatments. The positive global warming impact (GWI) of converted soybean fields under both CT (11.5 Mg CO2 eh a � 1 ) and NT (2.87 Mg CO2 eh a � 1 ) was in contrast to the negative GWI of the unconverted reference field (� 3.5 Mg CO2 eh a � 1 ) with on-going greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. N2O contributed 39.3% and 55.0% of the GWI under CT and NT systems with the remainder contributed by CO2 (60.7% and 45.0%, respectively). Including foregone mitigation, we conclude that NT management can reduce GHG costs by ~60% compared to CT during initial CRP conversion.

TI  - Measurement of Methane Production from Ruminants
PY  - 2007
AB  - : On a global scale agriculture and in particular enteric fermentation in ruminants is reported to produce about one fourth (21 to 25%) of the total anthropogenic emissions of methane (CH 4 ). Methane is produced during the anaerobic fermentation of hydrolyzed dietary carbohydrates in the rumen and represents an energy loss to the host besides contributing to emissions of greenhouse gases into the environment. However, there appears to be uncertainty in the CH 4 estimation from livestock due to the limited availability of data to document the variability at the farm level and also due to the significant impact of diet on the enteric CH 4 production. The methane mitigation strategies require robust prediction of emissions from rumen. There are many methods available which would be suitable for measuring CH 4 produced from the various stages of animal production. However, several factors need to be considered in order to select the most appropriate technique like the cost, level of accuracy required and the scale and design of the experiments to be undertaken. Selection of any technique depends on the accuracy as each one has its advantages and disadvantages. Screening of mitigation strategies may be evaluated using individual animal before large-scale trials on groups of animals are carried out. In this review various methods for the estimation of methane production from ruminants as well as for the determination of methane production potential of ruminant feeds are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods starting from respiration chamber, ventilated hood, facemask, sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) tracer technique, prediction equations and meteorological methods to in vitro methods are detailed.

TI  - Developing spatially stratified N2O emission factors for Europe
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract We investigate the possibility to replace the – so-called – Tier 1 IPCC approach to estimate soil N2O emissions with stratified emissions factors that take into account both N-input and the spatial variability of the environmental conditions within the countries of the European Union, using the DNDC-Europe model. Spatial variability in model simulations is high and corresponds to the variability reported in literature for field data. Our results indicate that (a) much of the observed variability in N2O fluxes reflects the response of soils to external conditions, (b) it is likely that national inventories tend to overestimate the uncertainties in their estimated direct N2O emissions from arable soils; (c) on average over Europe, the fertilizer-induced emissions (FIE) coincide with the IPCC factors, but they display large spatial variations. Therefore, at scales of individual countries or smaller, a stratified approach considering fertilizer type, soil characteristics and climatic parameters is preferable.

TI  - Increased eutrophication and nutrient imbalances in the agricultural soil of NE Catalonia, Spain.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The soil C, N, P and K content of agricultural soil were measured over the last 4 decades in NE Catalonia (NE Spain). Plant- available P and K increased by ca 109 and 105% respectively and total N decreased by 30%. The increases in plant-available P content are in accordance with the increasingly used pig slurry being very rich in P, and with P tendency to be retained in soils, since it is less mobile than N. The total soil N (N tot ) decrease occurred in the first decade (by 41%). The uptake and withdrawal of mineral N by crops and the leaching of mineral N into groundwater and rivers after torrential rainfalls were the two likely major pathways of N-loss from the soil. After the first decade, there has been no further decrease of N tot as a result of the increasing fertilization of these fields, including the increasing applications of pig slurry. These results show an increasing P eutrophication in Mediterranean agricultural soils and will have several consequences for the next decades with (i) an increasing unbalance between N and P (and K) in soils that might affect crop productivity, (ii) an increasing leaching of N as nitrate to continental waters, both ground and surface waters, and (iii) a consequent need for the establishment of another fertilization strategy based on lowering the use of pig slurry and on increasing the use of fertilizers of slow mineralization that increase soil organic matter, and stabilise the soil N and P contents.

TI  - Olive orchard amended with two experimental olive mill wastes mixtures: effects on soil organic carbon, plant growth and yield.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Amendments of olive orchard soil with two different preparations of olive mill solid waste (OMWMs) at the rate of 9 ton ha −1 per year for five years in two different plots were compared with an industry standard soil amendment using urea. Both the OMWMs amendments showed significant increases in total organic carbon and humic substances in soil of approximately 40% and 58%, respectively, without negative effects on tree growth and yield. This work has shown that olive oil mill waste (OMW) can be recycled safely using the bioremediation system used in this study. We suggest that this system is particularly beneficial to organic farming and is an alternative solution to direct spreading of raw OMW on farm lands.

TI  - Potential benefits and risks of land application of sewage sludge.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Sewage sludge, also referred as biosolids, is a byproduct of sewage treatment processes. Land application of sewage sludge is one of the important disposal alternatives. Characteristics of sewage sludge depend upon the quality of sewage and type of treatment processes followed. Being rich in organic and inorganic plant nutrients, sewage sludge may substitute for fertilizer, but availability of potential toxic metals often restricts its uses. Sludge amendment to the soil modifies its physico-chemical and biological properties. Crop yield in adequately sludge-amended soil is generally more than that of well-fertilized controls. Bioavailability of metals increases in sludge amended soil at excessive rates of application for many years. Plants differ in their abilities to absorb sludge-derived metals from the soil. The purpose of this paper is to review the available information on various aspects of sewage sludge application on soil fertility and consequent effects on plant production to explore the possibility of exploiting this byproduct for agronomy and horticulture.

TI  - Nitrifier denitrification as a distinct and significant source of nitrous oxide from soil
PY  - 2011
AB  - Soils are the major source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to our atmosphere. A thorough understanding of terrestrial N2O production is therefore essential. N2O can be produced by nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and by nitrifiers paradoxically denitrifying. The latter pathway, though well-known in pure culture, has only recently been demonstrated in soils. Moreover, nitrifier denitrification appeared to be much less important than classical nitrate-driven denitrification. Here we studied a poor sandy soil, and show that when moisture conditions are sub-optimal for denitrification, nitrifier denitrification can be a major contributor to N2O emission from this soil. We conclude that the relative importance of classical and nitrifier denitrification in N2O emitted from soil is a function of the soil moisture content, and likely of other environmental conditions as well. Accordingly, we suggest that nitrifier denitrification should be routinely considered as a major source of N2O from soil.

TI  - Carbon losses from soil and its consequences for land-use management
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper reviews our current knowledge and understanding of carbon processes in the terrestrial ecosystem with a view to reducing soil carbon losses by optimising land-use and land management. Processes that influence the fate of carbon (in both terms of quantity and quality) are important in determining soil fertility, quality and health as well as consequences for future environmental change scenarios. We need to understand the processes that determine soil carbon losses and the fate of the carbon once lost from the soil in order to provide sustainable solutions for mitigating these carbon losses as part of land management \"best practice\" and balancing national carbon budgets. Here we review the amount of carbon within the UK terrestrial pool, the processes involved and factors influencing carbon transport to and from soils, the fate of the carbon once it has been lost from the soil environment and land-use scenarios that affect carbon losses. We conclude with possible management options to reduce soil carbon loss and identify gaps in knowledge in order to better understand carbon processes in the terrestrial environment.

TI  - Very high resolution interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas.
PY  - 2005
AB  - We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

Summary
The substantial stocks of carbon sequestered in temperate grassland ecosystems are located largely below ground in roots and soil. Organic C in the soil is located in discrete pools, but the characteristics of these pools are still uncertain. Carbon sequestration can be determined directly by measuring changes in C pools, indirectly by using 13C as a tracer, or by simulation modelling. All these methods have their limitations, but long-term estimates rely almost exclusively on modelling. Measured and modelled rates of C sequestration range from 0 to > 8 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. Management practices, climate and elevated CO2 strongly influence C sequestration rates and their influence on future C stocks in grassland soils is considered. Currently there is significant potential to increase C sequestration in temperate grassland systems by changes in management, but climate change and increasing CO2 concentrations in future will also have significant impacts. Global warming may negate any storage stimulated by changed management and elevated CO2, although there is increasing evidence that the reverse could be the case.

TI  - Estimation of Nitrous Oxide Emissions from US Grasslands.
PY  - 2000
AB  - O) emissions from temperate grasslands are poorly quantified and may be an important part of the atmospheric N2O budget. In this study N2O emissions were simulated for 1052 grassland sites in the United States using the NGAS model of Parton and others (1996) coupled with an organic matter decomposition model. N2O flux was calculated for each site using soil and land use data obtained from the National Resource Inventory (NRI) database and weather data obtained from NASA. The estimates were regionalized based upon temperature and moisture isotherms. Annual N2O emissions for each region were based on the grassland area of each region and the mean estimated annual N2O flux from NRI grassland sites in the region. The regional fluxes ranged from 0.18 to 1.02 kg N2O N/ha/yr with the mean flux for all regions being 0.28 kg N2O N/ha/yr. Even though fluxes from the western regions were relatively low, these regions made the largest contribution to total emissions due to their large grassland area. Total US grassland N2O emissions were estimated to be about 67 Gg N2O N/yr. Emissions from the Great Plains states, which contain the largest expanse of natural grassland in the United States, were estimated to average 0.24 kg N2O N/ha/yr. Using the annual flux estimate for the temperate Great Plains, we estimate that temperate grasslands worldwide may potentially produce 0.27 Tg N2O N/yr. Even though our estimate for global temperate grassland N2O emissions is less than published estimates for other major temperate and tropical biomes, our results indicate that temperate grasslands are a significant part of both United States and global atmospheric N2O budgets. This study demonstrates the utility of models for regional N2O flux estimation although additional data from carefully designed field studies is needed to further validate model results.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from organic and conventional crop rotations in five European countries.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture are currently estimated from N inputs using emission factors, and little is known about the importance of regional or management-related differences. This paper summarizes the results of a study in which N2O emission rates were recorded on 15–26 occasions during a 12-month period in organic and conventional dairy crop rotations in five European countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, UK). A common methodology based on static chambers was used for N2O flux measurements, and N2O data were compiled together with information about N inputs (from fertilizers, N2 fixation, atmospheric deposition and excretal returns), crop rotations and soil properties. Organic rotations received only manure as N fertilizer, while manure accounted for 0–100% of fertilizer N in conventional rotations. A linear regression model was used to examine effects of location, system and crop category on N2O emissions, while a second model examined effects of soil properties. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher from conventional than from organic crop rotations except in Austria and, according to the statistical analysis, the differences between locations and crop categories were significant. Ammonium was significantly related to N2O emissions, although this effect was dominated by observations from a grazing system. Despite the limited number of samplings, annual emissions were estimated by interpolation. Across the two systems and five locations there was a significant relationship between total N inputs and N2O emissions at the crop rotation level which indicated that annually 1.6 ± 0.2% (mean ± standard error) of total N inputs were lost as N2O, while there was a background emission of 1.4 ± 0.3 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1. Although this measurement program emphasized system effects at the expense of high temporal resolution, the results indicate that N input is a significant determinant for N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

TI  - Residue management, conservation tillage and soil restoration for mitigating greenhouse effect by CO2-enrichment
PY  - 1997
AB  - This manuscript reviews the potential impact of residue management, conservation tillage and soil restoration on carbon sequestration in world soils. The greenhouse effect is among four principal ecological issues of global concern that include: (i) adequacy of land resources to meet needs of present and future generations; (ii) role of world soils and agricultural practices in the ‘greenhouse’ effect; (iii) potential of crop residue management, restoration of degraded soils, and conservation tillage in carbon sequestration in soil; and (iv) minimizing risks of soil degradation by enhancing soil resilience and soil quality. Annual increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is 3.2 × 1015 g, and there exists a potential to mitigate this effect through C sequestration in soils. Just as world soils are an important active pool of organic carbon and play a major role in the global carbon cycle, crop residue is a major renewable resource which also has an important impact on the global carbon cycle. I have estimated the annual production of crop residue to be about 3.4 billion Mg in the world. If 15% of C contained in the residue can be converted to passive soil organic carbon (SOC) fraction, it may lead to C sequestration at the rate of 0.2 × 1015 g/yr. Similarly restoring presently degraded soils, estimated at about 2.0 billion ha, and increasing SOC content by 0.01% /yr may lead C sequestration at the rate of 3.0 Pg C/yr. Conservation tillage is an important tool for crop residue management, restoration of degraded soil, and for enhancing C sequestration in soil. Conservation tillage, any tillage system that maintains at least 30% of the soil surface covered by residue, was practised in 1995 on about 40 × 106 ha or 35.5% of planted area in USA. It is projected that by the year 2020, conservation tillage may be adopted on 75% of cropland in USA (140 × 106 ha), 50% in other developed countries (225 × 106 ha), and 25% in developing countries (172 × 106 ha). The projected conversion of conventional to conservation tillage may lead to a global C sequestration by 2020 at a low estimate of 1.5 × 1015 g, and at a high estimate of 3.9 × 1015 g of C. These potentials of C sequestration can be realized through adoption of regional, national and global soil policy that stipulate appropriate use of world soil resources.

TI  - Soil carbon dioxide fluxes from conventional and no-tillage small-grain cropping systems
PY  - 1996
AB  - Conversion to conservation tillage systems increases soil C content by reducing soil erosion and the rate of organic matter oxidation. We hypothesized that these effects could impact soil emission of CO 2 . This study (i) determined if CO 2 emissions were reduced in the first years after conversion to no-tillage (NT) relative to conventional tillage (CT), (ii) evaluated whether differences in soil CO 2 emissions between tillage treatments were related to soil temperature differences, and (iii) determined if soil C02 emission measurements provided an early estimate of soil management practice impact on soil organic C. In 1992 and 1993, CT and NT plots were planted to small-grain cereals in Ottawa, Ontario, on a Dalhousie silt loam (mixed, mesic, Typic Endoaquoll). Fluxes were measured using closed chambers connected to a portable CO 2 analyzer. During growing season 1992, the CO 2 emissions varied from 0.05 to 0.18 mg CO 2 m -2 s -1 with an average of 0.12 mg CO 2 m -2 s -1 for CT and of 0.10 mg CO 2 m -2 s -1 for NT. In 1993, the CO 2 emissions varied from 0.06 to 0.35 mg CO 2 m -2 s -1 with an average of 0.15 mg C02 m -2 s -1 in both tillage treatments. Differences in soil CO 2 fluxes between treatments were related to differences in soil temperature (r 2 = 0.62), giving an estimate of 75 g C m -2 yr -1 difference in organic C transfers to the atmosphere between CT and NT. These results were validated using an independent estimation derived from long-term field experiments. Thus, soil CO 2 flux measurements using dynamic closed chambers can provide early estimates of soil management impacts on soil organic C.

TI  - Carbon budget and seasonal carbon dioxide emission from a central Ohio Luvisol as influenced by wheat residue amendment
PY  - 2002
AB  - Enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks through mulching has been proposed, and although this practice can alter several soil properties, its impact on the temporal variability of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission from soils has not been widely investigated. To that end, we monitored CO 2 fluxes from a central Ohio Luvisol (fine, mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf) amended with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw applied at rates of 0 (M0), 8 (M8) and 16 (M16) Mg dry matter ha -1 per year and supplemented with fertilizer (244 kg N ha -1 per year) or without. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with three replications. The intensity of CO 2 emission was higher in the late winter (mean: 2.79 g CO 2 -C m -2 per day) and summer seasons (2.45 g CO2-C m -2 per day) and lowest in the autumn (1.34 g C O 2-C m -2 per day). While no significant effect of N fertilization on CO 2 emission was detected, soil mulching had a significant effect on the seasonal variation of CO 2 fluxes. The percentage of annual CO 2 emitted during the winter and spring was similar across treatments (17-22%); however, 43% of the annual CO 2 loss in the M0 plots occurred during the summer as opposed to 26% in the mulch treatments. A close relationship (F = 0.47X + 4.45, R 2 = 0.97, P < 0.001) was found between annual CO 2 flux (F, Mg CO 2 -C ha -1 ) and residue-C input (X, Mg C ha -1 ). Litter and undecomposed residue amounted to 0.32 and 0.67 Mg C ha -1 per year in the M8 and M16 plots, respectively. After 4 years of straw application, SOC stocks (0-10 cm) were 19.6, 25.6 and 26.5 Mg C ha -1 in the M0, M8 and M16 treatments, respectively. The results show that soil mulching has beneficial effect on SOC sequestration and strongly influence the temporal pattern of CO 2 emission from soils.

TI  - Impact of reduced tillage and cover cropping on the greenhouse gas budget of a maize/soybean rotation ecosystem
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Agricultural ecosystems have been viewed with the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) through reduced tillage and cover cropping practices. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, regarding the carbon (C) sink/source potential of these systems and few studies have examined C dynamics in conjunction with other important greenhouse gases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an alternative management scenario (reduced tillage and cover cropping) on ecosystem respiration ( R E ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes in a maize ( Zea mays L.)/soybean ( Glycine max L.) rotation ecosystem in east-central Minnesota, United States. The control treatment was managed using fall tillage with a chisel plow in combination with a tandem disk, and the experimental treatment was managed using strip tillage and a winter rye ( Secal cereale ) cover crop. Over the two-year study period (2004–2005), cumulative R E was 222.7 g C m −2 higher in the alternatively managed treatment as a result of increased decomposition of the cover crop residue. N 2 O fluxes were similar in both treatments during the 2004 growing season and were 100.1 mg N m −2 higher in the conventional treatment during the 2005 growing season after nitrogen (N) fertilization. N fertilization and fertilizer type were the dominant factors controlling N 2 O fluxes in both treatments. CH 4 fluxes were negligible in both treatments and often below the detection limit. Cumulative growing season N 2 O losses in the control and experimental treatments, which totalled 38.9 ± 3.1 and 26.1 ± 1.7 g C m −2 when converted to CO 2 equivalents, were comparable to the annual estimates of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange in both treatments. This study further supports that N 2 O losses are an important component of the total greenhouse gas budget of agroecosystems. It also suggests that spring cover cropping, without residue removal, has limited C sequestration potential. The results from this study, however, may not necessarily represent equilibrium conditions in the experimental treatment. Rather, they are a measure of the transient response of the system after tillage conversion and cover crop addition. It is expected that the soil microbes will continue to adjust to the reduction in tillage and increased C inputs. Therefore, continued, long-term monitoring is needed to confirm whether the results are representative of equilibrium conditions.

TI  - Interacting effects of temperature, soil moisture and plant biomass production on ecosystem respiration in a northern temperate grassland
PY  - 2005
AB  - Chamber measurements of total ecosystem respiration (TER) in a native Canadian grassland ecosystem were made during two study years with different precipitation. The growing season (April–September) precipitation during 2001 was less than onehalf of the 30-year mean (1971–2000), while 2002 received almost double the normal growing season precipitation. As a consequence soil moisture remained higher in 2002 than 2001 during most of the growing season and peak aboveground biomass production (253.9 g m � 2 ) in 2002 was 60% higher than in 2001. Maximum respiration rates were approximately 9 mmol m � 2 s � 1 in 2002 while only approximately 5 mmol m � 2 s � 1 in 2001. Large diurnal variation in TER, which occurred during times of peak biomass and adequate soil moisture, was primarily controlled by changes in temperature. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q10) for ecosystem respiration was on average 1.83 � 0.08, and it declined in association with reductions in soil moisture. Approximately 94% of the seasonal and interannual variation in R10 (standardized rate of respiration at 10 8C) data was explained by the interaction of changes in soil moisture and aboveground biomass, which suggested that plant aboveground biomass was good proxy for accounting for variations in both autotrophic and heterotrophic capacity for respiration. Soil moisture was the dominant environmental factor that controlled seasonal and interannual variation in TER in this grassland, when variation in temperature was held constant. We compared respiration rates measured with chambers and that determined from nighttime eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Respiration rates measured by both techniques showed very similar seasonal patterns of variation in both years. When TER was integrated over the entire growing season period, the chamber method produced slightly higher values than the EC method by approximately 4.5% and 13.6% during 2001 and 2002, respectively, much less than the estimated uncertainty for both measurement techniques. The two methods for calculating respiration had only minor effects on the seasonal-integrated estimates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange and ecosystem gross photosynthesis.

TI  - Soil-Atmosphere Trace Gas Exchange in Semiarid and Arid Zones
PY  - 2008
AB  - A review is presented on trace gas exchange of CH 4 , CO, N 2 O, and NO x arising from agriculture and natural sources in the world's semiarid and arid zones due to soil processes. These gases are important contributors to the radiative forcing and the chemistry of the atmosphere. Quantitative information is summarized from the available studies. Between 5 and 40% of the global soil-atmosphere exchange for these gases (CH 4 , CO, N 2 0, and NO x ) may occur in semiarid and arid zones, but for each of these gases there are fewer than a dozen studies to support the individual estimates, and these are from a limited number of locations. Significant differences in the biophysical and chemical processes controlling these trace gas exchanges are identified through the comparison of semiarid and arid zones with the moist temperate or wet/dry savanna land regions. Therefore, there is a poorly quantified understanding of the contribution of these regions to the global trace gas cycles and atmospheric chemistry. More importantly, there is a poor understanding of the feedback between these exchanges, global change, and regional land use and air pollution issues. A set of research issues is presented.

TI  - THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND ITS RELATION TO CLIMATE AND VEGETATION
PY  - 2000
AB  - As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on .2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The per- centage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, inter- mediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests ( P , 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the to p3mo fsoil was 2344 Pg C, or 56% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500-1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.

TI  - Carbon losses from all soils across England and Wales 1978-2003
PY  - 2005
AB  - More than twice as much carbon is held in soils as in vegetation or the atmosphere, and changes in soil carbon content can have a large effect on the global carbon budget. The possibility that climate change is being reinforced by increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils owing to rising temperature is the subject of a continuing debate. But evidence for the suggested feedback mechanism has to date come solely from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and modelling studies. Here we use data from the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales obtained between 1978 and 2003 to show that carbon was lost from soils across England and Wales over the survey period at a mean rate of 0.6% yr(-1) (relative to the existing soil carbon content). We find that the relative rate of carbon loss increased with soil carbon content and was more than 2% yr(-1) in soils with carbon contents greater than 100 g kg(-1). The relationship between rate of carbon loss and carbon content is irrespective of land use, suggesting a link to climate change. Our findings indicate that losses of soil carbon in England and Wales--and by inference in other temperate regions-are likely to have been offsetting absorption of carbon by terrestrial sinks.

TI  - Carbon dioxide emissions after application of tillage systems for a dark red latosol in southern Brazil
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Soil tillage may influence CO 2 emissions in agricultural systems. Agricultural soils are managed in several ways in Brazil, ranging from no tillage to intensive land preparation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of common soil tillage treatments (disk harrow, reversible disk plow, rotary tiller and chisel plow tillage systems) on the intermediate CO 2 emissions of a dark red latosol, located in southern Brazil. Different tillage systems produced significant differences in the CO 2 emissions, and the results indicate that the chisel plow produced the highest soil carbon loss during the 15 days period after tillage treatments were performed. Emissions to the atmosphere increased as much as 74 g CO 2  m −2 , at the end of a 2-week period, in the plot where the chisel plow treatment was applied, in comparison to the non-disturbed plot. The results indicate that the total increase on the intermediate term soil CO 2 emissions due to tillage treatments in southern Brazil is comparable to that reported for the more humid and cooler regions.

TI  - Greenhouse gas contributions of agricultural soils and potential mitigation practices in Eastern Canada
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract Agricultural soils can constitute either a net source or sink of the three principal greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). We compiled the most up-to-date information available on the contribution of agricultural soils to atmospheric levels of these gases and evaluated the mitigation potential of various management practices in eastern Canada and northeastern USA. Conversion of native ecosystems to arable cropping resulted in a loss of ∼22% of the original soil organic carbon (C)—a release of about 123 Tg C to the atmosphere; drainage and cultivation of organic soils resulted in an additional release of about 15 Tg C. Management practices that enhance C storage in soil include fertilization and legume- and forage-based rotations. Adopting no-till did not always increase soil C. This apparent absence of no-till effects on C storage was attributed to the type and depth of tillage, soil climatic conditions, the quantity and quality of residue C inputs, and soil fauna. Emission of N2O from soil increased linearly with the amount of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer applied (0.0119 kg N2O-N kg N−1). Application of solid manure resulted in substantially lower N2O emission (0.99 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) than application of liquid manure (2.83 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) or mineral fertilizer (2.82 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Systems containing legumes produced lower annual N2O emission than fertilized annual crops, suggesting that alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and other legume forage crops be considered different from other crops when deriving national inventories of greenhouse gases from agricultural systems. Plowing manure or crop stubble into the soil in the autumn led to higher levels of N2O production (2.41 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) than if residues were left on the soil surface (1.19 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Elevated N2O emission during freeze/thaw periods in winter and spring, suggests that annual N2O emission based only on growing-season measurements would be underestimated. Although measurements of CH4 fluxes are scant, it appears that agricultural soils in eastern Canada are a weak sink of CH4, and that this sink may be diminished through manuring. Although the influence of agricultural management on soil C storage and emission of greenhouse gases is significant, management practices often appear to involve offsets or tradeoffs, e.g., a particular practice may increase soil C storage but also increase emission of N2O. In addition, because of high variability, adequate spatial and temporal sampling are needed for accurate estimates of greenhouse gas flux and soil C stock. Therefore a full accounting of greenhouse gas contributions of agricultural soils is imperative for determining the true mitigation potential of management practices.

TI  - Soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization kinetics in organic and conventional three-year cropping systems
PY  - 2010
AB  - The scientific literature regarding the use of C and N mineralization kinetics as a tool to highlight the effects of different cropping systems on soil C and N release is scarce. In this study we aimed to assess the effectiveness of these parameters in evaluating soil C and N potential release in organic (ORG) and conventional (CONV) three-year cropping systems. A long-term field study was established in 2001 at the University of Tuscia experimental farm (Viterbo, Italy) in a randomized block design. The soil is classified as Typic Xerofluvent or Dystric Fluvisol. In the CONV system the Good Agricultural Practice is adopted, whereas the ORG system is managed following the Regulation 2092/91/EEC. Both systems had a three-year crop rotation (pea – Pisum sativum L.; durum wheat – Triticum durum Desf.; tomato – Licopersicum esculentum Mill.). One of the main differences between the two systems is the soil N fertilization program: organic fertilizers (Guano: 6% N, 32% organic carbon and DIX10: 10% N, 42% organic carbon, both produced by Italpollina, Italy) and mineral nitrogen fertilizers (NH4NO3) were applied to ORG and CONV fields, respectively. Moreover, the rotation in the ORG system included common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.) as green manure crops. Our results supported the hypotheses in that the two systems differed significantly on potentially mineralizable C (C0) in 2008 and on potentially mineralizable N (N0) as nitrate form (N0-NO3−) in 2006 (318 μg C-CO2 g−1 28 d−1 vs. 220 μg C-CO2 g−1 28 d−1; 200 μg N-NO3− g−1 vs. 149 μg N-NO3− g−1 in ORG and CONV, respectively). The reduction of N0 in soil during the crop rotation period could reflect the N microbial immobilization since a negative correlation between microbial biomass N:total N ratio and N0 as ammonium form (N0-NH4+) (P < 0.001) as well as a positive correlation between N0-NH4+ and C:N ratio of microbial biomass (P < 0.05) were observed. Moreover, a lower potential mineralization rate of N was observed in soil with Guano (25%) than in soil with DIX10 (35%); nevertheless the former fertilizer might cover a longer period of crop N demand as a more gradual release of N0 was observed. In this work we demonstrated that the use of mineralization kinetics parameters can offer a potential to assess the mineralization–immobilization processes in soils under different climatic and management conditions. Moreover, they can be used to evaluate the most suitable N release pattern of organic fertilizers used in various cropping systems.

TI  - Methane emissions from cattle.
PY  - 1995
AB  - Increasing atmospheric concentrations of methane have led scientists to examine its sources of origin. Ruminant livestock can produce 250 to 500 L of methane per day. This level of production results in estimates of the contribution by cattle to global warming that may occur in the next 50 to 100 yr to be a little less than 2%. Many factors influence methane emissions from cattle and include the following: level of feed intake, type of carbohydrate in the diet, feed processing, addition of lipids or ionophores to the diet, and alterations in the ruminal microflora. Manipulation of these factors can reduce methane emissions from cattle. Many techniques exist to quantify methane emissions from individual or groups of animals. Enclosure techniques are precise but require trained animals and may limit animal movement. Isotopic and nonisotopic tracer techniques may also be used effectively. Prediction equations based on fermentation balance or feed characteristics have been used to estimate methane production. These equations are useful, but the assumptions and conditions that must be met for each equation limit their ability to accurately predict methane production. Methane production from groups of animals can be measured by mass balance, micrometeorological, or tracer methods. These techniques can measure methane emissions from animals in either indoor or outdoor enclosures. Use of these techniques and knowledge of the factors that impact methane production can result in the development of mitigation strategies to reduce methane losses by cattle. Implementation of these strategies should result in enhanced animal productivity and decreased contributions by cattle to the atmospheric methane budget.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions following application of residues and fertiliser under zero and conventional tillage
PY  - 2003
AB  - Emissions of N2O were measured following combined applications of inorganic N fertiliser and crop residues to a silt loam soil in S.E. England, UK. Effects of cultivation technique and residue application on N2O emissions were examined over 2 years. N2O emissions were increased in the presence of residues and were further increased where NH4NO3 fertiliser (200 kg N ha−1) was applied. Large fluxes of N2O were measured from the zero till treatments after residue and fertiliser application, with 2.5 kg N2O-N ha−1 measured over the first 23 days after application of fertiliser in combination with rye (Secale cereale) residues under zero tillage. CO2 emissions were larger in the zero till than in the conventional till treatments. A significant tillage/residue interaction was found. Highest emissions were measured from the conventionally tilled bean (Vicia faba) (1.0 kg N2O-N ha−1 emitted over 65 days) and zero tilled rye (3.5 kg N2O-N ha−1 over 65 days) treatments. This was attributed to rapid release of N following incorporation of bean residues in the conventionally tilled treatments, and availability of readily degradable C from the rye in the presence of anaerobic conditions under the mulch in the zero tilled treatments. Measurement of 15N-N2O emission following application of 15N-labelled fertiliser to microplots indicated that surface mulching of residues in zero till treatments resulted in a greater proportion of fertiliser N being lost as N2O than with incorporation of residues. Combined applications of 15N fertiliser and bean residues resulted in higher or lower emissions, depending on cultivation technique, when compared with the sum of N2O from single applications. Such interactions have important implications for mitigation of N2O from agricultural soils.

TI  - Effect of slope position and land use on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (Seine Basin, France)
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nitrous oxide emissions from soils are known to be variable in both space and time. To better understand this variability, this study was conducted to (i) evaluate the landscape-scale patterns and seasonal variations in N2O emissions, (ii) determine the contribution of the different environmental factors (texture and organic matter content of the soil, crop management, mineral nitrogen content, and fertilizer application) on the estimation of N2O emissions at the field scale. We used static chamber and gas chromatography methods to measure N2O emissions in the Orgeval sub-basin (Seine Basin, France), in representative sites selected on the basis of land use: a continuum from an agricultural plateau to the riparian buffer, grassland and a forest site. A consistent landscape-scale pattern of N2O emissions was observed with higher emissions in the footslope (annual flux of 4.0 ± 2.2 kg N ha −1 yr −1 ) than in the slope positions (1.1 ± 0.6 and 1.9 ± 1.2 kg N ha−1 yr−1) or the shoulder positions (1.1 ± 0.5 kg N ha−1 yr−1).

TI  - An inhibitor of urease activity effectively reduces ammonia emissions from soil treated with urea under Mediterranean conditions
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Urea is an important source of ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions to the atmosphere from agricultural soils. Abatement strategies are necessary in order to achieve NH 3 emission targets by reducing those emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out on a sunflower crop in spring 2006 with the aim of evaluating the effect of the N -( n -butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) in the mitigation of volatilized NH 3 from a urea-fertilised soil. Ammonia emission was quantified, using the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) method, following application of urea with and without the urease inhibitor NBPT. Urea and a mixture of urea and NBPT (0.14%, w/w) were surface-applied at a rate of 170 kg N ha −1 to circular plots (diameter 40 m). The soil was irrigated with 10 mm of water just after the application of urea to dissolve and incorporate it into the upper layer of soil. Over the duration of the measurement period (36 days) three peaks of NH 3 were observed. The first peak was associated with hydrolysis of urea after irrigation and the others with the increase of ammonia in soil solution after changes in atmospheric variables such as wind speed and rainfall. The total NH 3 emission during the whole experiment was 17.3 ± 0.5 kg NH 3 –N ha −1 in the case of urea treated soils and 10.0 ± 2.2 kg NH 3 –N ha −1 where NBPT was included with the urea (10.1 and 5.9%, respectively, of the applied urea–N). The lower NH 3 emissions from plots fertilised with urea + NBPT, compared with urea alone, were associated with a reduction in urease activity during the first 9 days after inhibitor application. This reduction in enzymatic activity promoted a decrease in the exchangeable NH 4 + pool.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes associated with soybean production under two tillage systems in southwestern Quebec
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Agricultural soils are an important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and the size of this contribution can be influenced by tillage practice and crop. The objective of this work was to study greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide—CO 2 and nitrous oxide—N 2 O) emissions associated with N 2 fixing soybean ( Glycine max ) grown under two tillage systems (conventional—CT and no-till—NT). The experiment was organized following a randomized complete block design with four blocks. The CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were evaluated throughout the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003. The seasonal emission patterns were different for CO 2 and N 2 O. Soil CO 2 emissions during the season were associated with soil temperature while the N 2 O fluxes were mainly associated with precipitation. The CT system generally had greater CO 2 fluxes than the NT system, particularly in 2002. In that year the maximum peak, which occurred in the summer, was about 160 g m −2  d −1 under CT and 68 g m −2  d −1 under NT. N 2 O emissions were low in the first year but high in the second, and were greater for CT than NT with a maximum peak about 18.1 mg m −2  d −1 under CT and 7.4 mg m −2  d −1 under NT. Our findings suggests that use of NT in the production of N 2 fixing soybean may reduce both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, in comparison to CT. Soybean residue incorporation increased N 2 O emissions, leading to greater emissions from the CT production system.

TI  - Effects of Cultural System (Organic and Conventional) on Growth, Photosynthesis and Yield Components of Sweet Corn (Zea mays L.) under Semi-Arid Environment
PY  - 2009
AB  - Organic sweet maize consists of a new industrial crop product. Field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of cultural systems on growth, photosynthesis and yield components of sweet maize crop (Zea mays L. F1 hybrid Midas). A randomized complete block design was employed with four replicates per treatment (organic fertilization: cow manure (5, 10 and 20 t ha1), poultry manure (5, 10 and 20 t ha1) and barley mulch (5, 10 and 20 t ha1), synthetic fertilizer (240 kg N ha1): 21-0-0 and control). The lowest dry weight, height and leaf area index and soil organic matter were measured in the control treatment. Organic matter content was proportionate to the amount of manure applied. The control plots had the lowest yield (1593 kg ha-1) and the double rate cow manure plots the had greatest one. (6104 kg ha-1). High correlation between sweet corn yield and organic matter was registered. Moreover, the lowest values of 1000-grain weight were obtained with control plot. The fertilizer plot gave values, which were similar to the full rate cow manure treatment. The photosynthetic rate of the untreated control was significantly lower than that of the other treatments. The photosynthetic rate increased as poultry manure and barley mulch rates decreased and as cow manure increased. Furthermore, the untreated control had the lowest stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. Our results indicated that sweet corn growth and yield in the organic plots was significantly higher than those in the conventional plots.

TI  - Silicate fertilization in no-tillage rice farming for mitigation of methane emission and increasing rice productivity.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Agricultural practices mostly influence methane (CH4) emissions from rice field, which must be controlled for maintaining the ecosystem balance. No-tillage farming with chemical amendments having electron acceptors could be an effective mitigation strategy in CH4 emissions from irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) field. An experiment was conducted in Korean paddy field under tillage and notillage farming practices with silicate iron slag amendments (1–4 Mg ha � 1 ) for suppressing CH4 emissions and maintaining rice productivity. It was found that CH4 emissions from the no-tillage rice field significantly decreased as compared to that of tilled field, irrespective of silicate amendments. The total seasonal CH4 flux from the control tillage and control no-tillage plots were recorded 38.1 and 27.9 g m � 2 , respectively, which were decreased by 20% and 36% with 4 Mg ha � 1 silicate amendment. Silicate fertilization (4 Mg ha � 1 ) with no-tillage system decreased total seasonal CH4 flux by 54% as compared to that of control tillage plot. This is most likely due to the higher concentrations of active iron and free iron oxides in the no-tilled rice field as compared to that of tilled field under silicate fertilization, which acted as electron acceptors and contributed to decrease CH4 emission. In addition, the improved soil porosity and redox potential, rice plant growth parameters such as active tillering rate, root volume and porosity, etc. in combination increased the rhizosphere oxygen concentrations and eventually suppressed CH4 emission during the rice growing season. The leaf photosynthetic rate was significantly increased with 4 Mg ha � 1 silicate amendment, which ultimately increased grain yield by 18% and 13% in the tilled and no-tilled rice field, respectively. CH4 flux showed a strong positive correlation with the availability of soil organic carbon, while there were negative correlations with soil porosity, soil pH, soil Eh, and the content of active iron and free iron oxides in soil.

TI  - Internal nutrient efficiencies of irrigated lowland rice in tropical and subtropical Asia
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract This study estimates the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) requirements of irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) in South- and Southeast Asia. Grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation in above-ground plant dry matter (DM) were measured at physiological maturity of rice ( n  ∼ 2000) in on-station and on-farm experiments in six Asian countries between 1995 and 1997. These data were used to model the nutrient requirements for yields up to 11 t ha −1 using the QUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) approach. The model required the estimation of two borderlines describing the minimum and maximum internal efficiencies (IE, kg grain per kg nutrient in plant DM), which were estimated at 42 and 96 kg grain kg −1 N, 206 and 622 kg grain kg −1 P and 36 and 115 kg grain kg −1 K, respectively. The model predicted a linear increase in grain yield if nutrients are taken up in balanced amounts of 14.7 kg N, 2.6 kg P and 14.5 kg K per 1000 kg of grain until yield targets reached ca. 70–80% of the climate-adjusted potential yield ( Y max ). The corresponding IEs were 68 kg grain kg −1 N, 385 kg grain kg −1 P and 69 kg grain kg −1 K for a balanced nutrition. The model predicted a decrease in IEs when yield targets approached Y max . The derived borderlines are valid for current modern, high-yielding indica cultivars with a harvest index of 0.50 kg kg −1 and can be used for all methods of crop establishment. Only Y max is required as site- or season-specific information when estimating nutrient requirements for a yield target making the model applicable for all irrigated lowlands in South- and Southeast Asia. Predicted IEs were greater than actual IEs measured in more than 200 farmers' fields ( n  ∼ 700), the latter averaging 59 kg grain kg −1 N (27–100 kg kg −1 ), 354 kg grain kg −1 P (158–1069 kg kg −1 ), and 64 kg grain kg −1 K (27–179 kg kg −1 ) with grain yields ranging from 1.5 to 9.9 t ha −1 (mean 5.2 t ha −1 ). Low and varying IEs in the farmers' practice were caused by nutritional imbalances, inadequate irrigation, or problems with pests and weeds.

TI  - Water erosion-induced CO2 emissions from tilled and no-tilled soils and sediments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract The acceleration of soil erosion by water in most regions of the world in response to the anthropogenic modification of landscapes is a serious threat to natural ecosystem functionalities because of the loss of invaluable constituents such as soil particles and organic carbon (OC). While soil OC erosion is likely to be a major component of the global C cycle, water erosion-induced CO2 emissions remain uncertain. In this study, our main objective was to compare the release of CO2 from eroded topsoils and from the sediments exported by diffuse erosion during an entire rainy season. Conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) maize treatments were considered in an attempt to set up best management practices to mitigate gaseous OC losses from agricultural soils. The study was conducted in the KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, whereas in many other areas of the developing world, erosion is severe and crop residue scarcity is the main challenge. CO2 emissions from undisturbed 0–0.02 m soil samples collected within 2.25 m × 10 m runoff plots and from exported sediments by water erosion, were evaluated continuously at the laboratory over a 140-day period and compared to soil OC stocks. NT significantly reduced CO2 emissions from both soils and sediments. Overall NT, which exhibited a greater carbon density than CT (17.70 vs 13.19 kg C m−3), reduced soil gaseous emissions by 4.4% (10.40 vs 10.88 g CO2-C m−2, P

TI  - Estimating generalized soil-water characteristics from texture
PY  - 1986
AB  - Soil-water potential and hydraulic conductivity relationships with soil-water content are needed for many plant and soil-water studies. Measurement of these relationships is costly, difficult, and often impractical. For many purposes, general estimates based on more readily available information such as soil texture are sufficient. Recent studies have developed statistical correlations between soil texture and selected soil potentials using a large data base, and also between selected soil textures and hydraulic conductivity. The objective of this study was to extend these results by providing mathematical equations for continuous estimates over broad ranges of soil texture, water potentials, and hydraulic conductivities. Results from the recent statistical analyses were used to calculate water potentials for a wide range of soil textures, then these were fit by multivariate analyses to provide continuous potential estimates for all inclusive textures. Similarly, equations were developed for unsaturated hydraulic conductivities for all inclusive textures. While the developed equations only represent a statistical estimate and only the textural influence, they provide quite useful estimates for many usual soil-water cases. The equations provide excellent computational efficiency for model applications and the textures can be used as calibration parameters where field or laboratory soil water characteristic data are available. Predicted values were successfully compared with several independent measurements of soil-water potential.

TI  - Tillage effects on gaseous emissions from an intensively farmed organic soil in North Central Ohio
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract As in other drained, intensively cultivated Histosols of the world, soil subsidence is a growing concern of vegetable farmers in the muck crops region of North Central, Ohio. Subsidence in organic soils is caused primarily by aerobic degradation of soil organic matter (SOM), which in turn makes available large quantities of once bound C and N. Upon drainage and cultivation, soil C and N dynamics shift drastically. Organic soils transition from CO 2 and organic N sinks, to persistent sources, whereas CH 4 uptake capacity increases. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the short-term (within the first year) impact of conversion of intensively tilled organic soils to no-till management. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) compare soil moisture content, soil temperature, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates from moldboard/disking (MB), no-till (NT), and bare (B) treatments in cultivated organic soils, and (ii) estimate the rate of subsidence associated with these tillage practices. Over the year, soil moisture content (SMC) was significantly higher in MB (0.90 kg kg −1 ) than B (0.84 kg kg −1 ) treatments; however NT (0.87 kg kg −1 ) was not significantly different from either MB or B treatments. Mean annual temperatures at 5 cm depth were significantly higher in B (16.9 °C) compared to MB (16.2 °C) and NT (15.9 °C) treatments The CO 2 emissions were not significantly different among treatments, while N 2 O emissions were significantly higher from MB (96.9 kg N 2 O-N ha −1  yr −1 ) than NT (35.8 kg N 2 O-N ha −1  yr −1 ) plots. Both CH 4 uptake and CH 4 emission exhibited low annual flux in all treatments.

TI  - Compaction effects on CO2 and N2O production during drying and rewetting of soil
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract The effects of compaction on soil porosity and soil water relations are likely to influence substrate availability and microbial activity under fluctuating soil moisture conditions. We conducted a short laboratory incubation to investigate the effects of soil compaction on substrate availability and biogenic gas (CO 2 and N 2 O) production during the drying and rewetting of a fine-loamy soil. Prior to initiating the drying and wetting treatments, CO 2 production (−10 kPa soil water content) from uncompacted soil was 2.3 times that of compacted soil and corresponded with higher concentrations of microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved organic C (DOC). In contrast, N 2 O production was 67 times higher in compacted than uncompacted soil at field capacity. Soil aeration rather than substrate availability (e.g. NO 3 − and DOC) appeared to be the most important factor affecting N 2 O production during this phase. The drying of compacted soil resulted in an initial increase in CO 2 production and a nearly two-fold higher average rate of C mineralization at maximum dryness (owing to a higher water-filled pore space [WFPS]) compared to uncompacted soil. During the drying phase, N 2 O production was markedly reduced (by 93–96%) in both soils, though total N 2 O production remained slightly higher in compacted than uncompacted soil. The increase in CO 2 production during the first 24 h following rewetting of dry soil was about 2.5 times higher in uncompacted soil and corresponded with a much greater release of DOC than in compacted soil. MBC appeared to be the source of the DOC released from uncompacted soil but not from compacted soil. The production of N 2 O during the first 24 h following rewetting of dry soil was nearly 20 times higher in compacted than uncompacted soil. Our results suggest that N 2 O production from compacted soil was primarily the result of denitrification, which was limited by substrates (especially NO 3 − ) made available during drying and rewetting and occurred rapidly after the onset of anoxic conditions during the rewetting phase. In contrast, N 2 O production from uncompacted soil appeared to be primarily the product of nitrification that was largely associated with an accumulation of NO 3 − following rewetting of dry soil. Irrespective of compaction, the response to drying and rewetting was greater for N 2 O production than for CO 2 production.

TI  - A review of the effects of tillage systems on some soil physical properties, water content, nitrate availability and crops yield in the Argentine Pampas
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract The Argentine Pampas is one of the most important cropping regions of the World. Limited tillage systems, and specially no-till, had widespread in recent years, occupying actually around 70% of the surface devoted to annual crops. We review results produced in field experiments installed along the Pampas to determine the effect of the adoption of these tillage systems on some soil properties and crops yield. It was performed a metanalysis of data from experiments where plow tillage (mouldboard plow), reduced tillage (chisel plow, disk plow or harrow disk) and no-till were compared. Treatments effects were contrasted by paired t -tests between groups of paired data. Soil bulk density and cone penetration resistance of the 0–20 cm layer were higher under limited tillage systems than under plow tillage. Increases of bulk density under no-till in comparison to plow tillage were generally small, averaging 4%, but cone penetration increased by 50% in many soils. The increase of bulk density was greater in soils of initial low bulk density. Neither bulk density increases nor cone penetration changes reached critical threshold for roots development. Aggregate stability and water infiltration rate were higher in soils subjected to limited tillage systems than under plow tillage. The improvement of aggregate stability was higher in poorer structured soils, with an average increase of 70% under no-till in relation to plow tillage. Under no-till infiltration rate doubled in average that of plow tillage. Soil water content during the critical periods of sowing and flowering was generally greater under limited tillage but, conversely, nitrate nitrogen levels were greater in plow tillage. Higher soil water content under no-till in relation to plow tillage may satisfied the evapotranspiration demand of 1–3 days of crops during the critical flowering period, being nitrate nitrogen in average 21 kg ha −1 lower under no-till. Soybean ( Glicine max (L.)-Merr.) yield was not affected by tillage system, meanwhile wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and corn ( Zea mays L.) yields were lower under reduced tillage and no-till than under plow tillage without nitrogen fertilization. Wheat and corn no-till yields were 10–14% lower that yields under plow tillage as a mean. When fertilizers were applied, wheat and corn yield differences between tillage treatments generally disappeared. The adoption of limited tillage systems in the Pampas leads to soil improvement but also generates the necessity of increase nitrogen fertilizers utilization to sustain yields of graminaceus crops.

TI  - The influence of gas transport and porosity on methane oxidation in soils
PY  - 1997
AB  - Two porosity-dependent parameters that affect gas transport in soils, gas diffusivity and air permeability, were assessed as possible indicators of methane oxidation rates. Soil gas diffusivity was measured in intact cores in the laboratory and in situ, and air permeability was measured in intact cores. An in situ method of measuring gas diffusivity was specifically modified for this purpose to use Freon in a portable probe. A laboratory (core) method of measuring gas diffusivity, using krypton 85, was also employed. Measurements were made at the soil surface and at a range of depths within the topsoil, in conjunction with in situ measurements of CH4 oxidation, in forest, arable, and set-aside soils at a lowland site and in a forest soil at an upland site, in southeast Scotland. The surface layer of soil caused marked variations in diffusivity measurements, particularly with the in situ method. At the upland site, where a 50-mm-thick surface organic layer was present, the in situ technique revealed a sharp decrease in diffusivity with depth. Only where gas transport was low, in the set-aside soil, was methane oxidation rate influenced by gas transport changes associated with increasing soil water content. Differences in CH4 oxidation rates related better to core gas diffusivities than to in situ diffusivities. The relationship was best at 50–150 mm depth where diffusivities were lower than at the surface. Air permeability, which is affected more by soil structure than diffusivity, appeared to be as relevant as the latter parameter to CH4 oxidation rate, particularly for land use changes associated with agriculture. Thus CH4 oxidation rate appears to be influenced by gas transport properties and soil structure, either at the surface in the litter layer or below the surface where the oxidizing microorganisms are likely to occur.

TI  - Increased concentration of water-soluble carbohydrate in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) : milk production from late lactation dairy cows
PY  - 2001
AB  - Eight multiparous Holstein‐Friesian dairy cows in late lactation were used to investigate the potential of using perennial ryegrass with a high concentration of watersoluble carbohydrate (WSC) to increase the efficiency of milk production. After a pretreatment period on a common pasture, the cows were each given ad libitum access to one of two varieties of zero-grazed grass continuously for 3 weeks. Treatments were: high sugar (HS), an experimental perennial ryegrass variety bred to contain high concentrations of WSC; or control, a standard variety of perennial ryegrass (cv. AberElan) containing typical concentrations of WSC. The two grass varieties were matched in terms of heading date. All animals also received 4 kg day ‐1 standard dairy concentrate. Grass dry matter (DM) intake was not significantly different between treatments (11AE6 vs. 10AE7 kg DM day ‐1 ; s.e.d. 0AE95 for HS and control diets respectively), although DM digestibility was higher on the HS diet (0AE71 vs. 0AE64 g g ‐1 DM; s.e.d. 0AE23; P <0 AE01) leading to higher digestible DM intakes for that diet. Milk yield from animals offered the HS diet was higher (15AE3 vs. 12AE6 kg day ‐1 ; s.e.d. 0AE87; P <0 AE05) and, although milk constituent concentrations were unaffected by treatment, milk protein yields were significantly increased on the HS diet. The partitioning of feed N was significantly affected by diet, with more N from the HS diet being used for milk production (0AE30 vs. 0AE23 g milk N g ‐1 feed N; s.e.d. 0AE012; P <0 AE01) and less being excreted in urine (0AE25 vs. 0AE35; s.e.d. 0AE020; P <0 AE01). In a separate experiment, using the same grasses harvested earlier in the season, the fractional rate of DM degradation, measured by in situ and gas production techniques, was higher for the HS grass than for the control. It is concluded that increased digestible DM intakes of the HS grass led to increased milk yields, whereas increased efficiency of utilization of the HS grass in the rumen resulted in the more efficient use of feed N for milk production and reduced N excretion.

TI  - Measurement of Net Global Warming Potential in Three Agroecosystems
PY  - 2005
AB  - When appraising the impact of food and fiber production systems on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the ‘greenhouse’ effect, the entire suite of biogenic greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) – needs to be considered. Storage of atmospheric CO2 into stable organic carbon pools in the soil can sequester CO2 while common crop production practices can produce CO2, generate N2O, and decrease the soil sink for atmospheric CH4. The overall balance between the net exchange of these gases constitutes the net global warming potential (GWP) of a crop production system. Trace gas flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage data from long-term studies, a rainfed site in Michigan that contrasts conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping, a rainfed site in northeastern Colorado that compares cropping systems in NT, and an irrigated site in Colorado that compares tillage and crop rotations, are used to estimate net GWP from crop production systems. Nitrous oxide emissions comprised 40–44% of the GWP from both rain-fed sites and contributed 16–33% of GWP in the irrigated system. The energy used for irrigation was the dominant GWP source in the irrigated system. Whether a system is a sink or source of CO2, i.e. net GWP, was controlled by the rate of SOC storage in all sites. SOC accumulation in the surface 7.5 cm of both rainfed continuous cropping systems was approximately 1100 kg CO2 equivalents ha−1 y−1. Carbon accrual rates were about three times higher in the irrigated system. The rainfed systems had been in NT for >10 years while the irrigated system had been converted to NT 3 years before the start of this study. It remains to be seen if the C accrual rates decline with time in the irrigated system or if N2O emission rates decline or increase with time after conversion to NT.

TI  - Nitrogen fertilizer effects on soil carbon balances in Midwestern U.S. agricultural systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - A single ecosystem dominates the Midwestern United States, occupying 26 million hectares in five states alone: the corn-soybean agroecosystem (Zea mays L.-Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Nitrogen (N) fertilization could influence the soil carbon (C) balance in this system because the corn phase is fertilized in 97-100% of farms, at an average rate of 135 kg Nha � 1� yr � 1 . We evaluated the impacts on two major processes that determine the soil C balance, the rates of organic-carbon (OC) inputs and decay, at four levels of N fertilization, 0, 90, 180, and 270 kg/ha, in two long-term experimental sites in Mollisols in Iowa, USA. We compared the corn-soybean system with other experimental cropping systems fertilized with N in the corn phases only: continuous corn for grain; corn-corn-oats (Avena sativa L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.; corn-oats-alfalfa-alfalfa; and continuous soybean. In all systems, we estimated long-term OC inputs and decay rates over all phases of the rotations, based on long- term yield data, harvest indices (HI), and root : shoot data. For corn, we measured these two ratios in the four N treatments in a single year in each site; for other crops we used published ratios. Total OC inputs were calculated as aboveground plus belowground net primary production (NPP) minus harvested yield. For corn, measured total OC inputs increased with N fertilization (P , 0.05, both sites). Belowground NPP, comprising only 6-22% of total corn NPP, was not significantly influenced by N fertilization. When all phases of the crop rotations were evaluated over the long term, OC decay rates increased concomitantly with OC input rates in several systems. Increases in decay rates with N fertilization apparently offset gains in carbon inputs to the soil in such a way that soil C sequestration was virtually nil in 78% of the systems studied, despite up to 48 years of N additions. The quantity of belowground OC inputs was the best predictor of long-term soil C storage. This indicates that, in these systems, in comparison with increased N-fertilizer additions, selection of crops with high belowground NPP is a more effective management practice for increasing soil C sequestration.

TI  - Methane emissions from double-rice cropping system under conventional and no tillage in southeast China
PY  - 2011
AB  - A field experiment was carried out to investigate the methane emission pattern in a double-rice cropping system under conventional and no tillage in southeast China. The treatments included conventional tillage cultivation in both early rice and late rice (T–T) and conventional tillage in early rice but no-till in late rice (T–NT). The maximum methane emission rate of T–T and T–NT was 21.71 mg m−2 h−1 and 24.70 mg m−2 h−1 in early rice, respectively; and 18.52 mg m−2 h−1 and 7.32 mg m−2 h−1 in late rice, respectively. The seasonal amount of methane emission from the T–T and T–NT was not significantly different in early rice, but significant different (P < 0.05) in late rice, with the values 6.57 g m−2 and 3.04 g m−2, respectively. In comparison with early rice, the seasonal amount methane flux of late rice was reduced by 29% and 68% in the T–T and T–NT, respectively. The decrease of methane emission in the T–NT was attributed to lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and higher soil bulk density. In conclusion, no tillage practice conducted in rice cropping season will markedly decrease methane emission for the rice cropping system.

TI  - Anaerobic digestates application on fodder crops : effects on plant and soil
PY  - 2013
AB  - A two-year field experiment was carried out to study the potential utilisation of anaerobic digestates as substitute of mineral fertilisers. To accomplish this objective, cumulative dry matter, plant nutrient and heavy metals content were determined on alfalfa and cocksfoot crops. Soil chemical properties and heavy metals content at the end of the experiment were also investigated. In alfalfa, no significant difference was found for cumulative dry weight among fertiliser treatments in both years, while in cocksfoot the mean yield of anaerobic digestates was higher than control, in first and second year, of the 41.3 and 23.0%, respectively. Therefore, the utilisation of these amendments could provide nutritive elements. Plant nutrient contents were not affected by fertiliser applied in both years and crops, showing no effects due to soil nutrient availability. No significant difference was found at the end of the experiment, since no accumulation of heavy metals was found in both plant and soil, these organic materials could be utilised in the short term period.

TI  - Protein degradation and fermentation characteristics of unwilted red clover and alfalfa silage harvested at various times during the day
PY  - 2002
AB  - Extensive proteolysis during fermentation of highprotein legumes reduces dietary N-use efficiency in ruminants. Research has demonstrated that enhancing the level of fermentable carbohydrates in crops entering the silo may reduce protein degradation by increasing the rate of decline in pH. The objective was to evaluate whether delaying cutting time during the day, to allow accumulation of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), would inhibit proteolysis in the silo. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were harvested at 06.00, 10.00, 14.00 and 18.00 hours in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and ensiled without wilting. TNC accumulated in fresh forage during the day, with starch accounting for more than 0AE50 of the daily change in TNC in fresh herbage of both species, except in red clover in 1995. The level of TNC in fresh forage did not consistently affect the extent of protein degradation in either species and, in all instances, alfalfa underwent more extensive proteolysis than red clover. Silage pH typically decreased and starch concentration increased as cutting time was delayed from 06.00 to 18.00 hours. Although the extent of proteolysis was largely unaffected by inherent increases in TNC, harvesting in the afternoon did provide several benefits including increased dry-matter content, lower silage pH and higher starch concentrations. Effluent production is a concern in any unwilted silage system; there was therefore an added advantage of lower moisture content from cutting in the afternoon.

TI  - Evidence for biological nitrification inhibition in Brachiaria pastures
PY  - 2009
AB  - Nitrification, a key process in the global nitrogen cycle that generates nitrate through microbial activity, may enhance losses of fertilizer nitrogen by leaching and denitrification. Certain plants can suppress soil-nitrification by releasing inhibitors from roots, a phenomenon termed biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). Here, we report the discovery of an effective nitrification inhibitor in the root-exudates of the tropical forage grass Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Schweick. Named “brachialactone,” this inhibitor is a recently discovered cyclic diterpene with a unique 5-8-5-membered ring system and a γ-lactone ring. It contributed 60–90% of the inhibitory activity released from the roots of this tropical grass. Unlike nitrapyrin (a synthetic nitrification inhibitor), which affects only the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) pathway, brachialactone appears to block both AMO and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzymatic pathways in Nitrosomonas. Release of this inhibitor is a regulated plant function, triggered and sustained by the availability of ammonium (NH4+) in the root environment. Brachialactone release is restricted to those roots that are directly exposed to NH4+. Within 3 years of establishment, Brachiaria pastures have suppressed soil nitrifier populations (determined as amoA genes; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea), along with nitrification and nitrous oxide emissions. These findings provide direct evidence for the existence and active regulation of a nitrification inhibitor (or inhibitors) release from tropical pasture root systems. Exploiting the BNI function could become a powerful strategy toward the development of low-nitrifying agronomic systems, benefiting both agriculture and the environment.

TI  - Carbon dioxide flux as affected by tillage and irrigation in soil converted from perennial forages to annual crops
PY  - 2007
AB  - Among greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most significant contributors to regional and global warming as well as climatic change. A field study was conducted to (i) determine the effect of soil characteristics resulting from changes in soil management practices on CO2 flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere in transitional land from perennial forages to annual crops, and (ii) develop empirical relationships that predict CO2 flux from soil temperature and soil water content. The CO2 flux, soil temperature (Ts), volumetric soil water content (θv) were measured every 1–2 weeks in no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) malt barley and undisturbed soil grass-alfalfa (UGA) systems in a Lihen sandy loam soil (sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustoll) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in western North Dakota. Soil air-filled porosity (e) was calculated from total soil porosity and θv measurements. Significant differences in CO2 fluxes between land management practices (irrigation and tillage) were observed on some measurement dates. Higher CO2 fluxes were detected in CT plots than in NT and UGA treatments immediately after rainfall or irrigation. Soil CO2 fluxes increased with increasing soil moisture (R2=0.15, P<0.01) while an exponential relationship was found between CO2 emission and Ts (R2=0.59). Using a stepwise regression analysis procedure, a significant multiple regression equation was developed between CO2 flux and θv, Ts (CO2flux=e-3.477+0.123Ts+6.381θvflux=e-3.477+0.123Ts+6.381θv; R2=0.68, P⩽0.01). Not surprisingly, soil temperature was a driving factor in the equation, which accounted for approximately 59% in variation of CO2 flux. It was concluded that less intensive tillage, such as no-till or strip tillage, along with careful irrigation management will reduce soil CO2 evolution from land being converted from perennial forages to annual crops.

TI  - The impact of breeding to reduce residual feed intake on enteric methane emissions from the Australian beef industry
PY  - 2006
AB  - The expected reduction in methane emissions from the Australian beef herd resulting from using bulls identified as being more feed efficient as a result of having a lower residual feed intake (RFI) was modelled, both in a single herd in southern Australia and in the national herd. A gene flow model was developed to simulate the spread of improved RFI genes through a breeding herd over 25 years, from 2002 to 2026. Based on the estimated gene flow, the voluntary feed intakes were revised annually for all beef classes using livestock populations taken from the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI). Changes in emissions (kg methane/animal.year) associated with the reduction in feed intake were then calculated using NGGI procedures. Annual enteric methane emissions from both the individual and national herd were calculated by multiplying the livestock numbers in each beef class by the revised estimates of emissions per animal. For an individual adopting herd, the annual methane abatement in year 25 of selection was 15.9% lower than in year 1. For the national herd, differential lags and limits to adoption were assumed for northern and southern Australia. The cumulative reduction in national emissions was 568 100 t of methane over 25 years, with annual emissions in year 25 being 3.1% lower than in year 1. It is concluded that selection for reduced RFI will lead to substantial and lasting methane abatement, largely as a consequence of its implementation as a breeding objective for the grazing beef herd.

TI  - Conservation Agriculture and Soil Carbon Sequestration: Between Myth and Farmer Reality
PY  - 2009
AB  - Improving food security, environmental preservation and enhancing livelihood should be the main targets of the innovators of today's farming systems. Conservation agriculture (CA), based on minimum tillage, crop residue retention, and crop rotations, has been proposed as an alternative system combining benefits for the farmer with advantages for the society. This paper reviews the potential impact of CA on C sequestration by synthesizing the knowledge of carbon and nitrogen cycling in agriculture; summarizing the influence of tillage, residue management, and crop rotation on soil organic carbon stocks; and compiling the existing case study information. To evaluate the C sequestration capacity of farming practices, their influence on emissions from farming activities should be considered together with their influence on soil C stocks. The largest contribution of CA to reducing emissions from farming activities is made by the reduction of tillage operations. The soil C case study results are not conclusive....

TI  - Genetic, functional and metabolic responses of soil microbiota in a sustainable olive orchard
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of two soil management systems so called sustainable treatment (ST) and conventional treatment (CT) on the composition and on genetic, functional, and metabolic diversity of soil microbial communities in a Mediterranean olive orchard. The ST system included no-tillage, integrated chemical fertilization, and organic matter inputs from drip irrigation, spontaneous cover crops, and pruning material. Microbial analyses were carried out by an integrated approach of culture-dependent (microbial cultures and Biolog) and culture-independent methods (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE]). After 7 years of treatment, average olive yield was 8.4 and 3.1 t ha−1 year−1 in ST and CT, respectively. Conventional treatment had a significantly higher number of total culturable bacteria and actinomycetes compared with ST, whereas fungi were significantly lower. In ST, the number of ammonifying bacteria, proteolytic bacteria, and Azotobacter in the wetted areas under the drippers (ST-WET) was significantly higher than along interrows (ST-INTER). The DGGE analysis of microbial 16S/18S rDNA showed differences between ST and CT, whereas 16S/18S rRNA DGGE bands of ST-WET clustered differently from those of CT and ST-INTER. Some Biolog metabolic indexes were significantly different between ST and CT. The results revealed qualitative and quantitative changes of soil microbial communities in response to sustainable agricultural practices that stimulate soil microorganism activity and improve olive yield and fruit quality.

TI  - Effect of catch crops on N dynamics and following crops in organic farming
PY  - 2008
AB  - Green manure catch crops promote the sustainability of agricultural systems by reducing soil erodibility and by nutrient uptake and transfer to the following main crops. This effect efficiently reduces the risk of nitrate leaching. Biological nitrogen fixation by legume catch crops is an additional benefit, mainly in organic farming. Such crops may, however, reduce nitrogen uptake from the soil and increase nitrate leaching. Additionally, under drought conditions, their extra water consumption may outweigh the beneficial effects. To determine the best catch crop management in stockless organic farming under dry, Pannonian site conditions in eastern Austria, four treatments were compared in 2002 and 2004: (1) legumes: field pea, common vetch and chickling vetch, (2) non-legumes: phacelia, oil radish and turnip, (3) a legume and non-legume mixture (all mentioned components), and (4) a bare fallow control. Our results show that catch crop biomass and N yield, biological N fixation, and crop N uptake from the soil were about 4 times higher under moderately dry conditions in 2002 than under drought conditions in summer and autumn 2004. In 2002, the legume/non-legume mixture had the highest biomass and N yield and the highest biological N fixation. Both the legume/non-legume mixture and the non-legumes were more efficient than legumes in N uptake from the soil (+32 kg N ha−1); and in reducing both soil inorganic N contents by −45 kg N ha−1 and nitrate concentrations in soil solution by −20 mg N L−. These findings show that the legume/non-legume mixture combined the positive effects of non-legumes and legumes. In 2004, catch crop effects did not differ except for their above-mentioned effect on inorganic N contents. The only pre-crop effect was that of legumes compared with non-legumes on spring barley grain dry matter of +0.6 Mg DM ha−1 and grain N yield of +17 kg N ha−1 in 2005. The water consumption of catch crops never adversely affected the following crops.

TI  - Global warming potential of wheat production in Western Australia: a life cycle assessment
PY  - 2008
AB  - This study presents a greenhouse gas (GHG) life cycle assessment of 1 tonne of wheat transported to port in south-western Australia, including emissions from prefarm, onfarm and postfarm stages. The prefarm stage included GHG emissions from agricultural machinery, fertiliser and pesticide production. The onfarm stage included GHG emissions from diesel use, liming and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from N fertiliser applications. The postfarm stage included grain storage and transportation to the port. GHG emissions decreased from 487 to 304kg carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalents when we used regional-specific data for N 2 O emissions instead of the IPCC default value for the application of synthetic N fertilisers to land (1.0%). Fertiliser production in the prefarm stage contributed significantly (35%) to GHG, followed by onfarm CO 2 emissions (27%) and emissions from transportation of inputs and wheat (12 %). N 2 O emissions from paddock represented 9% of the total GHGs emitted. We recommend utilising regionally specific data for soil N 2 O emissions, rather than international default values, when assessing GHG for agricultural production systems.

TI  - Renewable energy benefits with conversion of woody residues to pellets
PY  - 2009
AB  - In the frame of an Interreg IIIC Network-Operation named RegEnergy, that unites 18 partners from 11 countries of Europe, the feasibility of using the woody by-products for heating purpose in a typical Mediterranean region was investigated. Focusing on the Abruzzo Region as representative sample area, it came out that a significant amount of the above mentioned renewable energetic material is annually available as a consequence of well-consolidated and economically significant agro-industrial activities, forest maintenance and industrial wood production and transformation. In particular, it was found that the total amount of woody residues, as dry substance, are more than 700kt/a, with 30% resulting from pruning activities related to the cultivation of about 360km2 of vineyards and 450km2 of olive-groves; these residues are concentrated in the hilly part of the region close to the Adriatic sea coast. Starting by this pleasant situation, the feasibility of a properly localized wood pellets production plant was supported by both the economic and energetic analysis. Additional suggestions related to optimal plant localization and to the best use of the woody pellets as substitute of natural gas for heating purposes were reported along with the positive impact of the whole action on the quality of the environment and on the recovery of soil fertility.

TI  - Livestock methane emission: From the individual grazing animal through national inventories to the global methane cycle
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Methane is a potent greenhouse gas whose atmospheric abundance has grown 2.5-fold over three centuries, due in large part to agricultural expansion. The farming of ruminant livestock, which generate and emit methane during digestion (‘enteric fermentation’), is a leading contributor to this growth. This paper overviews the measurement or estimation of enteric methane emissions at a range of spatial scales. Measurement of individual animal emissions focuses particularly on grazing livestock for which the SF6 tracer technique is uniquely appropriate. Gaining insight into factors that influence methane production requires that feed intake and feed properties be determined, enabling the methane emitted to be expressed per unit of intake. The latter expression is commonly encapsulated in the ‘methane conversion factor’, Ym, an entity that enables small-scale methane emission estimates to be extrapolated to national and global enteric methane inventories. The principles of this extrapolation and sources of uncertainty are discussed, along with the significance of this global source within the global methane cycle. Micrometeorological and similar measurement techniques over intermediate spatial scales are also surveyed.

TI  - Winter Cover Crops Affect Monoculture Maize Yield and Nitrogen Leaching under Irrigated Mediterranean Conditions
PY  - 2010
AB  - Under semiarid Mediterranean conditions irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) has been associated with nitrate pollution of surface water and groundwater. Cover crops grown during the intercrop period of maize could reduce N leaching. A 2-yr experiment was conducted in drainage lysimeters with three cover crops: barley (Hordeum vulgare L), winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), or common vetch (Vicia sativa L.). Bare soil was used as control treatment. Maize was fertilized with 300 kg ha -1 N in the control, and this amount was reduced after a cover crop according to the N content in the aboveground cover crop biomass. Barley and winter rape biomass had a higher N content than vetch (130—170 vs. 50 kg ha -1 ). The vetch treatment did not reduce N leaching or affect maize yield. The barley and winter rape treatments reduced N leaching by 80% compared to the control (25 kg ha -1 yr -1 ) mainly due to a reduction of NO 3 -N concentration in drainage. Maize yield was reduced by 2.7 Mg ha -1 after barley and winter rape but still high (≈14 Mg ha -1 ). This reduction was due to an N deficiency caused by lower soil N in spring after the cover crop and insufficient N mineralization and/or lack of synchronization with maize N uptake. To use nonlegume winter cover crops to reduce N leaching in monoculture maize it is necessary to consider that N mineralization may not be sufficient to fulfill maize N requirements and N fertilizer adjustment tools should be developed.

TI  - Conservation agriculture and smallholder farming in Africa: The heretics' view
PY  - 2009
AB  - Conservation agriculture is claimed to be a panacea for the problems of poor agricultural productivity and soil degradation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is actively promoted by international research and development organisations, with such strong advocacy that critical debate is stifled. Claims for the potential of CA in Africa are based on widespread adoption in the Americas, where the effects of tillage were replaced by heavy dependence on herbicides and fertilizers. CA is said to increase yields, to reduce labour requirements, improve soil fertility and reduce erosion. Yet empirical evidence is not clear and consistent on many of these points nor is it always clear which of the principles of CA contribute to the desired effects. Although cases can be found where such claims are supported there are equally convincing scientific reports that contradict these claims. Concerns include decreased yields often observed with CA, increased labour requirements when herbicides are not used, an important gender shift of the labour burden to women and a lack of mulch due to poor productivity and due to the priority given to feeding of livestock with crop residues. Despite the publicity claiming widespread adoption of CA, the available evidence suggests virtually no uptake of CA in most SSA countries, with only small groups of adopters in South Africa, Ghana and Zambia. We conclude that there is an urgent need for critical assessment under which ecological and socio-economic conditions CA is best suited for smallholder farming in SSA. Critical constraints to adoption appear to be competing uses for crop residues, increased labour demand for weeding, and lack of access to, and use of external inputs.

TI  - Can no-tillage stimulate carbon sequestration in agricultural soils? A meta-analysis of paired experiments
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Adopting no-tillage in agro-ecosystems has been widely recommended as a means of enhancing carbon (C) sequestration in soils. However, study results are inconsistent and varying from significant increase to significant decrease. It is unclear whether this variability is caused by environmental, or management factors or by sampling errors and analysis methodology. Using meta-analysis, we assessed the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to conversion of management practice from conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT) based on global data from 69 paired-experiments, where soil sampling extended deeper than 40 cm. We found that cultivation of natural soils for more than 5 years, on average, resulted in soil C loss of more than 20 t ha−1, with no significant difference between CT and NT. Conversion from CT to NT changed distribution of C in the soil profile significantly, but did not increase the total SOC except in double cropping systems. After adopting NT, soil C increased by 3.15 ± 2.42 t ha−1 (mean ± 95% confidence interval) in the surface 10 cm of soil, but declined by 3.30 ± 1.61 t ha−1 in the 20–40 cm soil layer. Overall, adopting NT did not enhance soil total C stock down to 40 cm. Increased number of crop species in rotation resulted in less C accumulation in the surface soil and greater C loss in deeper layer. Increased crop frequency seemed to have the opposite effect and significantly increased soil C by 11% in the 0–60 cm soil. Neither mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall nor nitrogen fertilization and duration of adopting NT affected the response of soil C stock to the adoption of NT. Our results highlight that the role of adopting NT in sequestrating C is greatly regulated by cropping systems. Increasing cropping frequency might be a more efficient strategy to sequester C in agro-ecosystems. More information on the effects of increasing crop species and frequency on soil C input and decomposition processes is needed to further our understanding on the potential ability of C sequestration in agricultural soils.

TI  - Soil microbial diversity and community structure under wheat as influenced by tillage and crop rotation
PY  - 1998
AB  - Soil microbial diversity is important to sustainable agriculture because microbes mediate many processes that support agricultural production. The BIOLOG™ system for detection of specific patterns of substrate utilization by bacteria was used to investigate the effects of tillage and crop rotation on the diversity and community structure of soil bacteria. In each of 2 yr, soil was sampled (0–7.5 cm) in the wheat phase of different cropping rotations which had been established under zero tillage or conventional tillage on a Gray Luvisol in northern Alberta. Soil was collected from bulk soil at planting time and from bulk soil and wheat rhizosphere at flag-leaf stage of wheat growth. Tillage significantly (P<0.05) reduced the diversity of bacteria by reducing both substrate richness and evenness. The influence of tillage on microbial diversity was more prominent at the flag-leaf stage than at planting time and more prominent in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere at the flag-leaf stage. Microbial diversity was significantly higher under wheat preceded by red clover green manure or field peas than under wheat following wheat (continuous wheat) or summer fallow. The substrate utilization patterns of the bacterial communities also revealed that the bacterial community assemblages under conventional tillage had more similar structures than those under zero tillage. These results indicate that conservation tillage and legume-based crop rotations support diversity of soil microbial communities and may affect the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - Fertilizer standards for controlling groundwater nitrate pollution from agriculture: El Salobral-Los Llanos case study, Spain
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary Although the legislation on groundwater quality targets pollutant concentration, the effects of measures on non-point source pollution control are often evaluated in terms of their emission reduction potential at the source, not on their capacity of reducing the pollutant concentration in groundwater. This paper applies a hydro-economic modelling framework to an aquifer, El Salobral-Los Llanos aquifer (Mancha Oriental, Spain), where nitrate concentrations higher than those allowed by the EU Water Framework Directive and Groundwater Directive are locally found due to the intense fertilizer use in irrigated crops. The approach allows defining the economically optimal allocation of spatially variable fertilizer standards in agricultural basins using a hydro-economic model that links the fertilizer application with groundwater nitrate concentration at different control sites while maximizing net economic benefits. The methodology incorporates results from agronomic simulations, groundwater flow and transport into a management framework that yields the fertilizer allocation that maximizes benefits in agriculture while meeting the environmental standards. The cost of applying fertilizer standards was estimated as the difference between the private net revenues from actual application and the scenarios generated considering the application of the standards. Furthermore, the cost of applying fertilizer standards was compared with the cost of taxing nitrogen fertilizers in order to reduce the fertilizer use to a level that the nitrate concentration in groundwater was below the limit. The results show the required reduction of fertilizer application in the different crop areas depending on its location with regards to the control sites, crop types and soil–plant conditions, groundwater flow and transport processes, time horizon for meeting the standards, and the cost of implementing such a policy (as forgone benefits). According to the results, a high fertilizer price would be required to reduce nitrate concentrations in groundwater below the standard of 50 mg/l. In this particular case, it is more cost-efficient to apply standards to fertilizer use than taxes, although the instrument of fertilizer standards is more difficult to implement and control.

TI  - Carbon dioxide efflux in a rhodic hapludox as affected by tillage systems in southern Brazil
PY  - 2009
AB  - Os solos agricolas podem atuar como dreno ou fonte de C atmosferico, dependendo do sistema de manejo adotado. Este estudo foi desenvolvido em experimento de longa duracao (22 anos), durante o periodo de 30 dias do outono, com o objetivo de avaliar o impacto de sistemas de preparo de solo (preparo convencional-PC e plantio direto-PD) nas emissoes de C-CO2 de um Latossolo Vermelho distrofico, em Cruz Alta, RS. As emissoes de C-CO2 do solo foram avaliadas com câmaras dinâmica (Flux Chamber 6400-09, Licor) e estatica (com captacao em solucao alcalina), imediatamente apos a colheita da soja. A temperatura e a umidade do solo foram registradas, concomitantemente com as emissoes de C-CO2, por meio de sensor de temperatura e TDR manual, respectivamente, integrantes do Licor-6400. Estimou-se que, em 30 dias, uma quantidade equivalente a menos de 30 % do C aportado pelos residuos de soja foi emitida na forma de C-CO2. As emissoes de C-CO2 no solo em PD foram similares as emissoes do solo em PC, independentemente do tipo de câmara utilizada. Diferencas entre sistemas de preparo quanto a emissao de C-CO2, avaliadas com a câmara dinâmica, foram verificadas somente a curto prazo (leituras diarias), com o PD apresentando maiores emissoes do que o PC no inicio do periodo experimental e menores no final. A câmara dinâmica foi mais eficiente do que a estatica em captar as alteracoes das emissoes de C-CO2 em funcao da variacao da temperatura e a porosidade preenchida por agua (PPA) no solo em PD, as quais explicaram 83 e 62 % das emissoes de C-CO2, respectivamente. O fator Q10, que avalia a sensibilidade da emissao de C-CO2 a temperatura do solo, foi estimado em 3,93, indicando alta sensibilidade da atividade microbiana a temperatura do solo durante o outono. As emissoes de C-CO2 registradas no solo em PD com a câmara estatica foram correlacionadas as da câmara dinâmica, porem com valores subestimados em relacao aquela notadamente nos maiores valores de fluxo. Em condicoes de baixa temperatura e PPA, o preparo de solo induziu limitado incremento de emissao de C-CO2.

TI  - Impact of pig slurry on soil properties, water salinization, nitrate leaching and crop yield in a four‐year experiment in Central Spain
PY  - 2006
AB  - The repeated application of pig slurry to agricultural soils may result in an accumulation of salts and a risk of aquifer pollution due to nitrate leaching and salinization. Under Mediterranean conditions, a field experiment on a sandy loam soil (Typic Xerofluvent) was performed with maize (Zea mays) in 1998, 1999 and 2001 to study the effects of applying optimal (P1) and excessive rates (P3) of pig slurry on soil salinization, nitrate leaching and groundwater pollution. The rate of pig slurry was established considering the optimal N rate for maize in this soil (170, 162 and 176 kg N ha -1 for 1998, 1999 and 2001, respectively). Pig slurry treatments were compared to an optimal N rate supplied as urea (U) and a control treatment without N fertilizer (P0). The composition of the slurries showed great variability between years. Mean NO - 3 leaching losses from 1998 to 2001 were 329, 215, 173 and 78 kg N ha -1 for P3, P1, U and P0 treatments, respectively. The amount of total dissolved salts (TDS) added to the soil in slurry application between 1998 and 2001 was 2019 kg TDS ha -1 for the P1 treatment and 6058 kg TDS ha -1 for the P3 treatment. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity (EC) of the slurry-treated soils was greater than that of the control soil. The EC correlated significantly with the sodium concentration of the soil solution. Over the entire experimental period, 2653, 2202 and 2110 kg Na ha -1 entered the aquifer from the P3, P1 and PO treatments, respectively. The P3 treatment did not significantly increase grain production in 1999 and 2001 compared with that achieved with the optimal N rate treatment (P1). This behaviour shows the importance of establishing application guidelines for pig slurry that will reduce the risk of soil and groundwater pollution.

TI  - CO2 fluxes and drivers as affected by soil type, tillage and fertilization
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Importance of agricultural practices for greenhouse gases mitigation is examined worldwide. However, there is no consensus on CO2 emissions as affected by soil management practices. Deeper understanding of soil CO2 fluxes and drivers under different management practices are needed. The investigation of net CO2 exchange rate as dependent variable and drivers (soil water and temperature, air temperature) as affected by soil type (loam and sandy loam), tillage (conservation and no-tillage) and fertilization are presented. Soil management practices and weather conditions affected the CO2 flux through effects on soil water and temperature regime. Mean net CO2 exchange rate on sandy loam was 8% higher than on loam. No-tillage, as a moisture-conserving tool, could be an appropriate tool for CO2 emissions mitigation in any weather conditions on sandy loam; however, the advantage of no-tillage on loam was negligible. Mineral NPK fertilizers promoted significantly higher net CO2 exchange rate in both soils...

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions and isotopic composition in urban and agricultural systems in southern California
PY  - 2011
AB  - [1] Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas increasing in atmospheric mixing ratio and linked to increasing amounts of reactive N in the environment, particularly fertilizer use in agriculture. The consequences of urbanization of agricultural land for global and regional N2O emissions are unclear, due to high spatial and temporal variability of fluxes from different ecosystems and relatively few studies of urban ecosystems. We measured fluxes and the stable isotope composition (δ15N and δ18O) of N2O over 1 year in urban (ornamental lawns and athletic fields) and agricultural (corn and vegetable fields) ecosystems near Los Angeles, California, United States. We found that urban landscapes (lawns and athletic fields) have annual N2O fluxes equal to or greater than agricultural fields. Fertilization rates of urban landscapes were equal to or greater than agricultural fields, with comparable N2O emissions factors. δ15N and δ18O of N2O varied widely in all ecosystems, and were not consistent with ecosystem type, season, soil moisture, or temperature. There was, however, a consistent response of δ15N-N2O to pulses of N2O emission following fertilization, with an initial depletion in δ15N relative to prefertilization values, then gradual enrichment to background values within about 1 week. Preliminary scaling calculations indicated that N2O emissions from urban landscapes are approximately equal to or greater than agricultural emissions in urbanized areas of southern California, which further implies that current estimates of regional N2O emissions (based on agricultural land area) may be too low.

TI  - A review of the use of composted municipal solid waste in agriculture
PY  - 2007
AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) compost is increasingly used in agriculture as a soil conditioner but also as a fertilizer. Proponents of this practice consider it an important recycling tool since MSW would otherwise be landfilled and critics are concerned with its often elevated metal concentrations. Large amounts of MSW compost are frequently used in agriculture to meet crop N requirements and for the addition of organic matter. The main concern is loading the soil with metals that can result in increased metal content of crops. Furthermore, in some cases, metals and excess nutrients can move through the soil profile into groundwater. Municipal solid waste compost has also been reported to have high salt concentrations, which can inhibit plant growth and negatively affect soil structure. A review of relevant agricultural studies is presented as well as recommendations for improving MSW compost quality. Its safe use in agriculture can be ensured with source separation (or triage of MSW to be composted) as well as the development and implementation of comprehensive industry standards.

TI  - Nitrogen oxide emissions from an irrigated maize crop amended with treated pig slurries and composts in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 2007
AB  - Organic fertilizers may differ greatly in composition and as a result there may also be differences in nitrogen oxides emissions following their application to soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mineral and organic N fertilizers on the nitrification and denitrification processes, and consequently on N2O and NO emissions. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha � 1 . Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha � 1 for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha � 1 , for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56% (CPS + U) and 85% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased N2O emission by 27%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O in comparison with urea. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Simulating greenhouse gas budgets of four California cropping systems under conventional and alternative management
PY  - 2010
AB  - Despite the importance of agriculture in California's Central Valley, the potential of alternative management practices to reduce soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been poorly studied in California. This study aims at (1) calibrating and validating DAYCENT, an ecosystem model, for conventional and alternative cropping systems in California's Central Valley, (2) estimating CO2, N2O, and CH4 soil fluxes from these systems, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty around model predictions induced by variability in the input data. The alternative practices considered were cover cropping, organic practices, and conservation tillage. These practices were compared with conventional agricultural management. The crops considered were beans, corn, cotton, safflower, sunflower, tomato, and wheat. Four field sites, for which at least five years of measured data were available, were used to calibrate and validate the DAYCENT model. The model was able to predict 86–94% of the measured variation in crop yields and 69–8...

TI  - Short-term temporal changes of soil carbon losses after tillage described by a first-order decay model
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Tillage stimulates soil carbon (C) losses by increasing aeration, changing temperature and moisture conditions, and thus favoring microbial decomposition. In addition, soil aggregate disruption by tillage exposes once protected organic matter to decomposition. We propose a model to explain carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission after tillage as a function of the no-till emission plus a correction due to the tillage disturbance. The model assumes that C in the readily decomposable organic matter follows a first-order reaction kinetics equation as: d C sail ( t )/d t  = − kC soil ( t ) and that soil C-CO 2 emission is proportional to the C decay rate in soil, where C soil ( t ) is the available labile soil C (g m −2 ) at any time ( t ). Emissions are modeled in terms soil C available to decomposition in the tilled and non-tilled plots, and a relationship is derived between no-till ( F NT ) and tilled ( F T ) fluxes, which is: F T = a 1 F NT e − a 2 t , where t is time after tillage. Predicted and observed fluxes showed good agreement based on determination coefficient ( R 2 ), index of agreement and model efficiency, with R 2 as high as 0.97. The two parameters included in the model are related to the difference between the decay constant ( k factor) of tilled and no-till plots ( a 2 ) and also to the amount of labile carbon added to the readily decomposable soil organic matter due to tillage ( a 1 ). These two parameters were estimated in the model ranging from 1.27 and 2.60 ( a 1 ) and −1.52 × 10 −2 and 2.2 × 10 −2  day −1 ( a 2 ). The advantage is that temporal variability of tillage-induced emissions can be described by only one analytical function that includes the no-till emission plus an exponential term modulated by tillage and environmentally dependent parameters.

TI  - Expanding the global network of protected areas to save the imperiled mediterranean biome.
PY  - 2008
AB  - : Global goals established by the Convention on Biological Diversity stipulate that 10% of the world's ecological regions must be effectively conserved by 2010. To meet that goal for the mediterranean biome, at least 5% more land must be formally protected over the next few years. Although global assessments identify the mediterranean biome as a priority, without biologically meaningful analysis units, finer-resolution data, and corresponding prioritization analysis, future conservation investments could lead to more area being protected without increasing the representation of unique mediterranean ecosystems. We used standardized analysis units and six potential natural vegetation types stratified by 3 elevation zones in a global gap analysis that systematically explored conservation priorities across the mediterranean biome. The highest levels of protection were in Australia, South Africa, and California-Baja California (from 9–11%), and the lowest levels of protection were in Chile and the mediterranean Basin ( 30% conversion and suggest that these assemblages be elevated to high-priority status in future conservation efforts.




Resumen: Las metas globales establecidas por la Convencion sobre Diversidad Biologica estipulan que 10% de las regiones ecologicas del mundo deberan estar conservadas efectivamente en 2010. Para alcanzar esa meta en el bioma mediterraneo, por lo menos 5% mas de superficie debe estar protegida formalmente en los proximos anos. Aunque las evaluaciones globales identifican al bioma mediterraneo como una prioridad, sin unidades de analisis biologicamente significativas, datos de resolucion mas fina y los correspondientes analisis de priorizacion, las inversiones futuras en conservacion pudieran conducir a la proteccion de mas superficie sin incrementar la representacion de los ecosistemas mediterraneos unicos. Utilizamos unidades de analisis estandarizadas y seis tipos potenciales de vegetacion natural estratificados en tres zonas de elevacion en un analisis global de disparidad que exploro sistematicamente las prioridades de conservacion en el bioma mediterraneo. Los niveles de proteccion mas altos se localizaron en Australia, Africa del Sur y California-Baja California (de 9–11%) y los niveles de proteccion mas bajos se localizaron en Chile y la Cuenca del mediterraneo ( 30% de conversion y sugerimos que estos ensambles sean elevados a un estatus de alta prioridad en esfuerzos de conservacion en el futuro.

TI  - Organic layer and clay content control soil organic carbon stocks in density fractions of differently managed German beech forests
PY  - 2013
AB  - Forest management and associated litter inputs and decomposition rates are thought to affect the carbon storage in mineral soils. Here, we studied the effects of forest management on soil organic carbon (OC) stocks in density fractions of Ah-horizons in soils that developed on loess. We used 82 beech (Fagus sylv- atica L.) dominated forest plots in Thuringia, Germany that differed in their management (unmanaged forest, forests under age-class management and forests under selection cutting forest). After density frac- tionation of the mineral soil with a 1.6 g cm � 3 polytungstate solution we determined OC concentrations and stocks as well as CN-ratios in the free (f-LF) light fraction, the occluded (o-LF) light fraction and in the mineral associated organic matter (MOM) fraction. In our study, Ah-horizons of beech forests stored on average 2.6 ± 0.2 kg m � 2 (38.7 ± 1.3 kg m � 3 ) OC. The results showed that 37% of the bulk soil OC was stored in the light fractions. We could show that OC stocks in the light fraction were significantly affected by the amount of C stored in organic layers (p = 0.011). The OC stocks in the organic layers, in turn, were higher in unmanaged forests and in forests under selection cutting. This suggests a sensitivity of unpro- tected OC in the f-LF of beech forests against forest management. In contrast to the f-LF, the OC stocks in the MOM fraction are mainly controlled by pedogenic properties such as clay and iron oxide content. Even after several decades of forest management and with large sample size, an effect of forest manage- ment on the stable MOM fraction could not be detected.

TI  - Improvement in soil structure associated with white clover
PY  - 1993
AB  - Observations have been made which suggest that clover is more effective than ryegrass in developing rapid improvements in soil structure. To test this hypothesis, grass, grass/clover and clover swards were grown in undisturbed field cores. Significant differences in drainage rates and plant biomass production, and visible changes in soil structure, all supported the hypothesis that clover improves structure rapidly, but there were no significant differences in bulk density, porosity or aggregate stability between the treatments. Soil moisture characteristic curves of soil/peat/grit compost planted with grass, grass/clover or clover and grown for two years indicate that a more free-draining structure develops under clover than under grass due to a higher ratio of macro- to micropores.

TI  - Loss of nitrogen from urea applied to rainfed wheat in varying rainfall zones in northern Syria.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Fertilizer-applied Nitrogen (N) may be lost from the soil by various mechanisms, i.e., runoff, leaching, denitrification, and volatilization. The latter process is of primary concern in calcareous soils of arid and semi-arid regions, especially when urea is used. In this field study from northern Syria, urea alone, urea with either an incorporated urease inhibitor, phenylphosphorodiamidate, or an experimental bran-wax coating were evaluated on wheat for two cropping seasons at two experimental stations with varying average seasonal rainfall (340 mm, 270 mm). Loss of N was assessed with 15N by mass balance, i.e., the amount of N applied minus the crop N uptake and N remaining in the soil. Crop yields and N uptake were related to seasonal rainfall. Losses of N, apparently as volatilized NH3, were relatively low at both sites, i.e., 11–18%. However, compared to the unmodified urea, neither the incorporated urease inhibitor nor the bran-wax coating had any effect on yields, N uptake or N loss. While urea hydrolysis is normally rapid, it may be delayed by dry conditions at the soil surface; similarly, unusually cold periods may delay nitrification following hydrolysis. Thus, under the cool-season conditions of rainfed cropping in the Middle East, efficient use of urea is not likely to be achieved by modification of the urea but by conventional management practices that ensure pre-plant soil incorporation or topdressing during early spring rains.

TI  - Influence of freshwater marsh tillage on microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen
PY  - 2008
AB  - The changes in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were examined in order to assess the effect of surface layer soil (0 - 10 cm) under different land-use types after freshwater marshes tillage in the Sanjiang Plain Northeast China. Land uses were Deyeuxia angustifolia freshwater marshes ((DAM), cultivated land (CL), recovery freshwater marsh (RFM), constructed woodland (CW). After DAM soil tillage, MBC, MBN, DOC and DON declined strongly in agricultural surface soil layer, decreased 63.8%-80.5% (MBC), 56.3%-67.1% (MBN), 43.1%-44.3% (DOC) and 25.2%-56.1% (DON) respectively. In contrast, these C, N fraction had significant recovered in RFM and CW surface soil, increased 36.1%-59.9% (MBC), 46.7%-65.9% (MBN), 67.0%-69.3% (DOC)and 81.2%-88.3% (DON) respectively. Cultivation and land-use affected soil MBC, MBN, DOC and DON intensely. Therefore these labile C, N fractions have the significant relative under different land-use types. However DOC was more obvious controlled than DON by the land-use types. The relative between DOC and MBC, MBN have much difference than DON, the main reason of this distinction is the diverse source in available carbon and nitrogen that taken by microbial property under different land uses.

TI  - Biosphere-atmosphere exchange of reactive nitrogen and greenhouse gases at the NitroEurope core flux measurement sites: measurement strategy and first data sets
PY  - 2009
AB  - The NitroEurope project aims to improve understanding of the nitrogen (N) cycle at the continental scale and quantify the major fluxes of reactive N by a combination of reactive N measurements and modelling activities. As part of the overall measurement strategy, a network of 13 flux ‘super sites’ (Level-3) has been established, covering European forest, arable, grassland and wetland sites, with the objective of quantifying the N budget at a high spatial resolution and temporal frequency for 4.5 years, and to estimate greenhouse gas budgets (N2O, CH4 and CO2). These sites are supported by a network of low-cost flux measurements (Level-2, 9 sites) and a network to infer reactive N fluxes at 58 sites (Level-1), for comparison with carbon (C) flux measurements. Measurements at the Level-3 sites include high resolution N2O, NO (also CH4, CO2) fluxes, wet and dry N deposition, leaching of N and C and N transformations in plant, litter and soil. Results for the first 11 months (1.8.2006 to 30.6.2007) suggest that the grasslands are the largest source of N2O, that forests are the largest source of NO and sink of CH4 and that N deposition rates influence NO and N2O fluxes in non-agricultural ecosystems. The NO and N2O emission ratio is influenced by soil type and precipitation. First budgets of reactive N entering and leaving the ecosystem and of net greenhouse gas exchange are outlined. Further information on rates of denitrification to N2 and biological N2 fixation is required to complete the N budgets for some sites. The quantitative roles played by CO2, N2O and CH4 in defining net greenhouse gas exchange differ widely between ecosystems depending on the interactions of climate, soil type, land use and management.

TI  - Carbon losses by tillage under semi-arid Mediterranean rainfed agriculture (SW Spain)
PY  - 2009
AB  - Conservation tillage has been promoted as a solution to counteract constraints caused by intensive agriculture. In this work the effects of two conservation tillage systems, reduced tillage (RT) and no-tillage (NT) were compared to the tradi tional tillage (TT) in a long- (15 years, RT) and short-term experiment (3 years, NT). Both experiments were carried out under semi-arid, rainfed agriculture of Mediterranean SW Spain. Tillage caused a sharp increase in soil CO 2 emissions immediately after tillage implementation, with a maximum value of 6.24 g CO 2 m -2 h -1 under long-term TT treatment. Along the year, losses of carbon through CO 2 emission were higher (905 and 801 g C m -2 year -1 for the long- and shortterm TT treatments respectively), than those estimated for conservation systems (764 and 718 g C m -2 year -1 for RT and NTrespectively).Conservationtillagesystemsaccumulatedmoresoilorganiccarbon(SOC )insurfacethanthecorrespon dingTT treatments (1.24 and 1.17 times greater for RT and NT, respectively, at 0-10 cm depth).

TI  - Responses of soil microbial processes and community structure to tillage events and implications for soil quality
PY  - 2003
AB  - The short-term responses of soil microbial processes and community structure to perturbation constitute one aspect of soil quality. Such responses are often associated with an increase in the emissions of greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2, NO, or N2O) and the accumulation and potential loss of nitrate by leaching. Here we describe our recent work on responses of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, microbial biomass, and microbial community structure to a tillage event in intensively managed vegetable crop systems in California. Our results indicate that CO2 emission is high for the first day after tillage, but respiration declines or remains constant, suggesting that physical processes are responsible for the high flux from the soil surface. Net mineralization and nitrate accumulation increase for several days after tillage, and this can be accompanied by higher denitrification rates. Tillage causes immediate changes in microbial community structure, based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, but little concomitant change in total microbial biomass. Tillage events contribute to decreased soil quality by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, and increasing the potential for nitrate leaching to groundwater, and these negative aspects must be weighed against the benefits of tillage for increasing the health and productivity of some crops.

TI  - The importance of the fallow period for N2O and CH4 fluxes and nitrate leaching in a Mediterranean irrigated agroecosystem
PY  - 2010
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of nitrous oxide (N 2 0) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes, and leaching losses of nitrate (NO 3 ― ) and dissolved organic C (DOC), during a fallow-onion crop-fallow cycle in a Mediterranean area. The importance of the fallow (intercrop) period and the type of fertilizer were also evaluated. Goat and chicken manure (M) from an organic farm, digested pig slurry (DPS) and urea (U) were applied at a rate of 110 kg N ha ―1 and compared with a zero N treatment (Control). The crop period contributed more than each fallow period to the total N 2 0 emission (ranging from 70 to 85% of the total emission, depending on the treatment). The variability of rainfall during fallow periods affected N 2 0 emissions, with the highest fluxes observed in the second fallow, which was the wetter. Negative net fluxes of N 2 0 (0 to ―0.4 mg N 2 0-N m ―2 day ―1 ) were mainly observed during the irrigation period and in fallow periods. The type of fertilizer had no effect on N 2 0 fluxes, but influenced the CH 4 oxidation. The largest CH 4 emission was from the manure treatment (2.4 mg CH 4 -C m ―2 day ―1 ) during the irrigation period. The lowest NO 3 ― but highest DOC leaching rates were measured during the second fallow period from the manure treated plots (0.2 kg NO 3 ― -N ha ―1 and 3.9 kg C ha ―1 ), which also had the highest drainage. The use of OM, therefore, seems to be a suitable method to reduce the environmental impacts associated with N leaching as well as increase the potential to denitrify NO 3 ― in groundwater.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized, irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in the Aral Sea Basin, Uzbekistan: Influence of nitrogen applications and irrigation practices
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Nitrous oxide emissions were monitored at three sites over a 2-year period in irrigated cotton fields in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, a region located in the arid deserts of the Aral Sea Basin. The fields were managed using different fertilizer management strategies and irrigation water regimes. N2O emissions varied widely between years, within 1 year throughout the vegetation season, and between the sites. The amount of irrigation water applied, the amount and type of N fertilizer used, and topsoil temperature had the greatest effect on these emissions. Very high N2O emissions of up to 3000 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 were measured in periods following N-fertilizer application in combination with irrigation events. These “emission pulses” accounted for 80–95% of the total N2O emissions between April and September and varied from 0.9 to 6.5 kg N2O-N ha−1.. Emission factors (EF), uncorrected for background emission, ranged from 0.4% to 2.6% of total N applied, corresponding to an average EF of 1.48% of applied N fertilizer lost as N2O-N. This is in line with the default global average value of 1.25% of applied N used in calculations of N2O emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. During the emission pulses, which were triggered by high soil moisture and high availability of mineral N, a clear diurnal pattern of N2O emissions was observed, driven by daily changes in topsoil temperature. For these periods, air sampling from 8:00 to 10:00 and from 18:00 to 20:00 was found to best represent the mean daily N2O flux rates. The wet topsoil conditions caused by irrigation favored the production of N2O from NO3− fertilizers, but not from NH4+ fertilizers, thus indicating that denitrification was the main process causing N2O emissions. It is therefore argued that there is scope for reducing N2O emission from irrigated cotton production; i.e. through the exclusive use of NH4+ fertilizers. Advanced application and irrigation techniques such as subsurface fertilizer application, drip irrigation and fertigation may also minimize N2O emission from this regionally dominant agro-ecosystem.

TI  - Tillage-induced environmental conditions in soil and substrate limitation determine biogenic gas production
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Tillage changes soil environmental conditions and controls the distribution of residues in the soil, both actions that affect the production and emission of soil biogenic gases (CO2, N2O, and CH4). The objective of this study was to determine how tillage-induced environmental conditions and substrate quality affect the mineralization rate of easily metabolizable compounds and the subsequent production of these gases. Carbon compounds, with and without nitrogen, were applied to soil cropped to maize under tilled and no-till systems. Following substrate application in the spring and summer, biogenic gases were measured periodically at the soil surface (flux) and within the profile (concentration) at 10-, 20-, and 30-cm depths (i.e., within, at the bottom of, and below the plough layer). Strong CO2 and N2O responses to sucrose and glycine in both the field and the laboratory indicate that the soil was C- and N-limited. Surface fluxes of CO2 and N2O were greater in soils amended with glycine than with sucrose and were greater in tilled than no-till soils. Transient emission of CH4 following the addition of glycine was observed and could be attributed to inhibition of N mineralization and nitrification processes on CH4 oxidation. Laboratory and field measurements indicated that the larger substrate-induced CO2 emission from the tilled soils could not be attributed to differences in the total biomass or the basal respiratory activity of the soils. Thus, there appears to be no underlying difference in the functional capacity of the microbial communities under different tillage regimes. Comparison of gas profiles indicates relative accumulation of CO2 at depth in soils under no-till, as well as greater decline in profile CO2 content with time in the tilled compared to the no-till soil. These results support the conclusion that greater CO2 efflux from the tilled soils resulted from more rapid gas diffusion through the profile. Hence, the observed differences in gas fluxes between tilled and no-till soils can be attributed to differences in physical environment.

TI  - Global Potential of Soil Carbon Sequestration to Mitigate the Greenhouse Effect
PY  - 2003
AB  - An increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 from 280 ppmv in 1750 to 367 ppmv in 1999 is attributed to emissions from fossil fuel combustion estimated at 270±30 Pg C and land use change at 136±55 Pg. Of the emissions from land use change, 78±12 Pg is estimated from depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Most agricultural soils have lost 50 to 70% of their original SOC pool, and the depletion is exacerbated by further soil degradation and desertification. The restoration of degraded soils, conversion of agriculturally marginal lands to appropriate land use, and the adoption of recommended management practices on agricultural soils can reverse degradative trends and lead to SOC sequestration. Technological options for SOC sequestration on agricultural soils include adoption of conservation tillage, use of manures, and compost as per integrated nutrient management and precision farming strategies, conversion of monoculture to complex diverse cropping systems, meadow-based rotations and winter cover...

TI  - Nitrous oxide fluxes from a grain-legume crop (narrow-leafed lupin) grown in a semiarid climate
PY  - 2011
AB  - Understanding nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from grain–legume crops in semiarid and arid regions is necessary if we are to improve our knowledge of global terrestrial N2O losses resulting from biological N2 fixation. N2O fluxes were measured from a rain-fed soil, cropped to a grain–legume in a semiarid region of southwestern Australia for 1 year on a subdaily basis. The site included plots planted to narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius; ‘lupin’) and plots left bare (no lupin). Fluxes were measured using soil chambers connected to a fully automated system that measured N2O by gas chromatography. Daily N2O fluxes were low (−0.5 to 24 g N2O-N ha−1 day−1) and not different between treatments, culminating in an annual loss of 127 g N2O-N ha−1. Greatest daily N2O fluxes occurred from both treatments in the postharvest period, and following a series of summer and autumn rainfall events. At this time of the year, soil conditions were conducive to soil microbial N2O production: elevated soil water contents, increased inorganic nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and soil temperatures generally > 25 °C; furthermore, there was no active plant growth to compete for mineralized N. N2O emissions from the decomposition of legume crop residue were low, and approximately half that predicted using the currently recommended IPCC methodology. Furthermore, the contribution of the biological N2 fixation process to N2O emissions appeared negligible in the present study, supporting its omission as a source of N2O from the IPCC methodology for preparing national greenhouse gas inventories.

TI  - Soil and water protection using conservation tillage in Northern and Central Europe
PY  - 2004
AB  - SOWAP is an acronym for a project called Soil And Water Protection Using Conservation Tillage In Northern And Central Europe aiming to assess the viability of a more “conservation-oriented” agriculture in the UK, Belgium and Hungary. SOWAP works at the farm scale, with detailed monitoring taking place at the plot level. The conservation tillage systems tested by the project will be applied at field sites in the three countries. Local variations and farmer/land owner preference will be considered and documented, making use of the WOCAT methodology. The consultation and participation by all stakeholders is critical to the success of SOWAP. Economic aspects as well as environmental benefits will be assessed for the conventional practice, for a conservation tillage practice devised by SOWAP in co-operation with the farmer and for a SOWAP “appropriate practice” crop solution. The impact of the three cultivation practices will be compared on run-off plots by measuring sediment and water run-off, loss of soil nutrients/fertilizers, and pesticide losses. Secondly, separate areas of the monitoring sites will be used to assess the impacts of the practices on soil ecology and soil physical-chemical properties, with particular emphasis on reduction of off-site pollution, enhancement of soil structure and carbon sequestration and increase of biodiversity, due to conservation practices Further assessments will be made of the impacts on larger species e.g. birds and fish.

TI  - Soil Carbon Saturation Controls Labile and Stable Carbon Pool Dynamics
PY  - 2008
AB  - Recently, it has been suggested that soil organic C (SOC) does not always respond linearly to increasing C input, thereby limiting the rate and efficiency of C stabilization in soils. Therefore, we postulated that when a soil is exposed to a broad range of C inputs through a range of manure treatments, it will show C saturation behavior and different SOC pools will saturate at different rates. To test this, different SOC pools were isolated by physical fractionation techniques from a long-term agricultural experiment in Lethbridge, Canada. In this experiment, manure has been applied since 1973 at rates of 0, 60, 120, and 180 Mg ha -1 yr -1 (wet weight). In the total mineral soil as well as the small macroaggregates (250-2000 μm), microaggregates (53-250 μm), and the silt plus clay fraction ( 2000 μm) were the only water-stable aggregate fraction that increased in C content across all manure input levels. Further physical separation of macroaggregates into subpools by microaggregate isolation showed that coarse (>250 μm) particulate organic matter (POM) was the fraction that accounted most for the increase in C content of the large macroaggregates. Furthermore, the turnover of large macroaggregates increased with increasing manure applications, as indicated by decreased formation and stabilization of intramicroaggregate POM within the large macroaggregates. We conclude that as C input increases, the mineral fraction of a soil saturates and consequently additional C input will only accumulate in labile soil C pools that have a relatively faster turnover.

TI  - Fundamental Differences Between Conventional and Organic Tomato Agroecosystems in California
PY  - 1995
AB  - In an integrated, multidisciplinary study we compared ecological characteristics and productivity of commercial farms categorized as either organic (ORG) or conventional (CNV) based on their use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides or reliance on organic soil amendments and biological pest control. We measured belowground parameters: various soil chemical and biological properties and root disease severity; common agronomic indicators: biomass, fruit yield and insect pest damage; and community level indicators, including arthropod diversity and soil microbial activity and diversity. CNV and ORG production systems could not be distinguished based on agronomic criteria such as fruit yield and arthropod pest damage levels. However, differences were demonstrated in many soil, plant, disease, and diversity indicators suggesting that the ecological processes determining yields and pest levels in these two management systems are distinct. In particular, nitrogen mineralization potential and microbial and parasitoid abundance and diversity were higher in ORG farms. Differences between the agroecosystems were sufficiently robust to be distinguished from environmental variation and suggest that biological processes compensated for reductions in the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

TI  - Soil management systems and short term CO2 emissions in a clayey soil in southern Spain
PY  - 2011
AB  - The soil in general and that destined for agricultural use, more specifically, can act as a source or sink of carbon, hence its direct involvement in strategies for mitigating climate change. A large proportion of this mitigation potential is produced by the sequestration of carbon by soils and, to a lesser extent, by a reduction in emissions from the soil. The most effective practices for increasing the organic carbon in the soils are generally those linked to conservation agriculture, which includes practices of no tillage or minimum tillage and the use of cover crops. During the farming seasons of 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10, a trial was conducted in which the carbon dioxide emissions in soil with a high percentage of clay in the Vega de Carmona (Seville) were estimated, and it was determined how climate conditions and the adoption of conservation agriculture practices vs. the use of traditional tillage influenced the flux of gas into the atmosphere.

TI  - Long-term effect of contrasted tillage and crop management on soil carbon dynamics during 41 years
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of tillage on soil organic carbon (SOC), there is still no consensus on the importance of sequestration which can be expected from reduced tillage. Most studies have used a synchronic approach in fields or long-term experiments which were often poorly characterized with respect to initial conditions. In this paper, we used a diachronic approach to quantify SOC changes in a 41 years experiment comparing no-till (NT), shallow till (ST) and full inversion tillage (FIT) combined with crop managements (residues removal, rotation and catch crops). It included SOC measurements at time 0 and every 4 years, calculations at equivalent soil mass within or below the old ploughed layer. Results show that tillage or crop management had no significant effect on SOC stocks after 41 years both in the old ploughed layer (ca. 0–28 cm) and deeper (ca. 0–58 cm). Tillage had no effect on crop yields and residues. In the reduced tillage treatments (ST and NT), SOC accumulated in the surface layer (0–10 cm), reaching a plateau after 24 years but declined continuously in the lower layer (10–28 cm) at a rate of 0.42–0.44% yr−1. The difference in SOC stocks (ST or NT minus FIT) over the old ploughed layer followed a non-monotonic pattern over time. Reduced tillage caused a rapid SOC sequestration during the first 4 years which remained more or less constant (mean = 2.17 and 1.31 t ha−1, resp.) during the next 24 years and disappeared after 28 years. The drop was attributed to the higher water balance recorded during years 24–28. In the reduced tillage treatments, the changes in SOC over time were negatively correlated with the water balance, indicating that sequestration rate was positive in dry periods and negative in wet conditions. This study highlights the interest of diachronic approaches to understand the effect of tillage and its interaction with environmental and management factors.

TI  - Calculation of theoretical and empirical nutrient N critical loads in the mixed conifer ecosystems of southern California.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Edaphic, foliar, and hydrologic forest nutrient status indicators from 15 mixed conifer forest stands in the Sierra Nevada, San Gabriel Mountains, and San Bernardino National Forest were used to estimate empirical or theoretical critical loads (CL) for nitrogen (N) as a nutrient. Soil acidification response to N deposition was also evaluated. Robust empirical relationships were found relating N deposition to plant N uptake (N in foliage), N fertility (litter C/N ratio), and soil acidification. However, no consistent empirical CL were obtained when the thresholds for parameters indicative of N excess from other types of ecosystems were used. Similarly, the highest theoretical CL for nutrient N calculated using the simple mass balance steady state model (estimates ranging from 1.4-8.8 kg N/ha/year) was approximately two times lower than the empirical observations. Further research is needed to derive the thresholds for indicators associated with the impairment of these mixed conifer forests exposed to chronic N deposition within a Mediterranean climate. Further development or parameterization of models for the calculation of theoretical critical loads suitable for these ecosystems will also be an important aspect of future critical loads research.

TI  - No‐Till Impact on Soil and Soil Organic Carbon Erosion under Crop Residue Scarcity in Africa
PY  - 2011
AB  - Although no-till (NT) is now practiced in many countries of the world, for most smallholders, the crop residues are of such a value that they cannot be left on the soil surfaces to promote soil protection, thus potentially limiting NT benefits and adoption. In this study our main objective was to evaluate runoff, soil, and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses from traditional small-scale maize (Zea mays) field under conventional tillage (T) and NT, with crop residues cover of less than 10% during the rainy season, in South Africa. Six runoff plots of 22.5 m² (2.25 × 10 m) under NT and T since 2002 were considered. At each plot, soil bulk density (ρb) and SOC content of the 0–0.02 m layer were estimated at nine pits. Top-soil SOC stocks were 26% higher under NT than under T (P = 0.001). The NT reduced soil losses by 68% (96.8 vs. 301.5 g m⁻² yr⁻¹, P = 0.001) and SOC losses by 52% (7.7 vs. 16.2 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹, P = 0.001), and differences in runoff were not significant. Dissolved organic carbon accounted for about 10% of total SOC losses and showed significantly higher concentrations under T than NT (1.49 versus 0.86 mg C m⁻² yr⁻¹). The less erosion in NT compared to T was explained by a greater occurrence under NT of indurated crusts, less prone to soil losses. These results showed the potential of NT even with low crop residue cover (<10%) to significantly reduce soil and SOC losses by water under small-scale agriculture.

TI  - Soil CO2 efflux following rotary tillage of a tropical soil
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract Stopping the increase of atmospheric CO 2 level is an important task and information on how to implement adjustments on tillage practices could help lower soil CO 2 emissions would be helpful. We describe how rotary tiller use on a red latosol affected soil CO 2 efflux. The impact of changing blade rotation speed and rear shield position on soil CO 2 efflux was investigated. Significant differences among treatments were observed up to 10 days after tillage. Cumulative CO 2 efflux was as much as 40% greater when blade rotation of 216 rpm and a lowered rear shield was compared to blade rotation of 122 rpm and raised shield. This preliminary work suggests that adjusting rotary tiller settings could help reduce CO 2 efflux close to that of undisturbed soil, thereby helping to conserve soil carbon in tropical environments.

TI  - Can less yield more? Is reducing nutrient input into the environment compatible with maintaining crop production?
PY  - 2004
AB  - Plant scientists have long recognized the need to develop crops that absorb and use nutrients more efficiently. Two approaches have been used to increase nutrient use efficiency (NUE) in crop plants. The first involves both traditional breeding and marker-assisted selection in an attempt to identify the genes involved. The second uses novel gene constructs designed to improve specific aspects of NUE. Here, we discuss some recent developments in the genetic manipulation of NUE in crop plants and argue that an improved understanding of the transition between nitrogen assimilation and nitrogen recycling will be important in applying this technology to increasing crop yields. Moreover, we emphasize the need to combine genetic and transgenic approaches to make significant improvements in NUE.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Re-packed soil columns of the Crediton series were sown with white clover or perennial ryegrass, with nitrate managed according to organic and conventional farming regimes respectively. Visual observations revealed a rapid enhancement in soil structure beneath white clover compared to ryegrass and unplanted soil. Enhanced structural differentiation beneath white clover was supported by greater permeability to air and freer drainage to water. Differences in soil structure were verified by water retention measurements over a range of tensions between the wilting and gravity drainage points. The void structure was simulated with the Pore-Cor network model, which verified larger pores beneath clover, a difference in local structuring and a saturated hydraulic conductivity which was four times greater than ryegrass. The study highlighted inadequacies in current approaches to the measurement and interpretation of water retention.

TI  - Temperate grasslands and global atmospheric change: a review
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary
Recent reviews confirm and extend previous observations that elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations stimulate photosynthesis, leading to increased plant productivity. Elevated CO2 concentrations tend to reduce the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to low levels of precipitation but induce progressive nitrogen (N) limitations on plant growth which can be alleviated by supplying a significant external input of N in the form of mineral fertilizer or through the increased use of N-fixing legumes. Other nutrients, such as phosphorus, can act as the main limiting factor restricting the growth response in legumes to atmospheric CO2 concentration. The botanical composition of temperate grasslands is affected by the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, possibly through a decline in the relative abundance of grasses. Elevated CO2 concentration will also alter the feeding value of herbage to grazers both in terms of fine-scale (for example, crude protein concentration and C:N ratio) and coarse-scale (legumes vs. grasses and C3- vs. C4-species) changes. The management guidelines of grasslands will need to be adapted to global atmospheric and climatic changes and to increased variability in climate.

TI  - Long-term impact of reduced tillage and residue management on soil carbon stabilization: Implications for conservation agriculture on contrasting soils
PY  - 2007
AB  - Residue retention and reduced tillage are both conservation agricultural management options that may enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization in tropical soils. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of long-term tillage and residue management on SOC dynamics in a Chromic Luvisol (red clay soil) and Areni-Gleyic Luvisol (sandy soil) in Zimbabwe. At the time of sampling the soils had been under conventional tillage (CT), mulch ripping (MR), clean ripping (CR) and tied ridging (TR) for 9 years. Soil was fully dispersed and separated into 212–2000 mm (coarse sand), 53–212 mm (fine sand), 20–53 mm (coarse silt), 5–20 mm (fine silt) and 0–5 mm (clay) size fractions. The whole soil and size fractions were analyzed for C content. Conventional tillage treatments had the least amount of SOC, with 14.9 mg C g � 1 soil and 4.2 mg C g � 1 soil for the red clay and sandy soils, respectively. The highest SOC content was 6.8 mg C g � 1 soil in the sandy soil under MR, whereas for the red clay soil, TR had the highest SOC content of 20.4 mg C g � 1 soil. Organic C in the size fractions increased with decreasing size of the fractions. In both soils, the smallest response to management was observed in the clay size fractions, confirming that this size fraction is the most stable. The coarse sand-size fraction was most responsive to management in the sandy soil where MR had 42% more organic C than CR, suggesting that SOC contents of this fraction are predominantly controlled by amounts of C input. In contrast, the fine sand fraction was the most responsive fraction in the red clay soil with a 66% greater C content in the TR than CT. This result suggests that tillage disturbance is the dominant factor reducing C stabilization in a clayey soil, probably by reducing C stabilization within microaggregates. In conclusion, developing viable conservation agriculture practices to optimize SOC contents and long-term agroecosystem sustainability should prioritize the maintenance of C inputs (e.g. residue retention) to coarse textured soils, but should focus on the reduction of SOC decomposition (e.g. through reduced tillage) in fine textured soils. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of climate and management intensity on nitrous oxide emissions in grassland systems across Europe
PY  - 2007
AB  - Soil/atmosphere exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide were monitored for a 3-year period at 10 grassland sites in eight European countries (Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom), spanning a wide range of climatic, environmental and soil conditions. Most study sites investigated the influence of one or several management practices on N2O exchange, such as nitrogen fertilization and grazing intensity. Fluxes were measured using non-steady state chambers at most sites, and alternative measurement techniques such as eddy covariance and fast-box using tunable diode laser spectroscopy were implemented at some sites. The overall uncertainty in annual flux estimates derived from chamber measurements may be as high as 50% due to the temporal and spatial variability in fluxes, which warrants the future use of continuous measurements, if possible at the field scale. Annual emission rates were higher from intensive than from extensive grasslands, by a factor 4 if grazed (1.77 versus 0.48 kg N2O-N ha?1 year?1) and by a factor 3 if ungrazed (0.95 versus 0.32 kg N2O-N ha?1 year?1). Annual emission factors for fertilized systems were highly variable, ranging from 0.01% to 3.56%, but the mean emission factor across all sites (0.75%) was substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1.25%. Emission factors for individual fertilization events increased with soil temperature and were generally higher for water-filled pore space values in the range 60?90%, though precipitation onto dry soils was also shown to lead to high losses of N2O-N from applied fertilizer. An empirical, multiple regression model to predict N2O emission factors on the basis of soil temperature, moisture and rainfall is developed, explaining half of the variability in observed emission factors.Peer reviewe

TI  - Distribution and Peculiarity of Mediterranean Ecosystems
PY  - 1973
AB  - The lands of mediterranean scrub or chaparral climate and the ecosystems that have developed in them must be defined in climatic terms. If we attempt to focus on the characteristic core of a mediterranean scrub or chaparral climate three terms stand out, two involving precipitation and one temperature. The most distinctive term involves the concentration of rainfall in the winter half year, November through April in the northern hemisphere and May through October in the southern. Although at a large number of stations, especially in California and Chile, 80 or even 90% of the precipitation occurs in winter, so large a proportion rarely obtains around the Mediterranean Basin itself. The value of at least sixty five percent of the year’s precipitation occurring in the winter half year seems, on the basis of examining a considerable number of station records, to form a satisfactory boundary. Winter rainfall, because of lower evaporation, is more effective in sustaining plant growth than is warm season precipitation; nonetheless, in this climatic region all but favorably located phreatophytic vegetation is subject to drought stress in summer.

TI  - Emissions of N2O and NO from fertilized fields: Summary of available measurement data
PY  - 2002
AB  - [1] Information from 846 N2O emission measurements in agricultural fields and 99 measurements for NO emissions was summarized to assess the influence of various factors regulating emissions from mineral soils. The data indicate that there is a strong increase of both N2O and NO emissions accompanying N application rates, and soils with high organic-C content show higher emissions than less fertile soils. A fine soil texture, restricted drainage, and neutral to slightly acidic conditions favor N2O emission, while (though not significant) a good soil drainage, coarse texture, and neutral soil reaction favor NO emission. Fertilizer type and crop type are important factors for N2O but not for NO, while the fertilizer application mode has a significant influence on NO only. Regarding the measurements, longer measurement periods yield more of the fertilization effect on N2O and NO emissions, and intensive measurements (≥1 per day) yield lower emissions than less intensive measurements (2–3 per week). The available data can be used to develop simple models based on the major regulating factors which describe the spatial variability of emissions of N2O and NO with less uncertainty than emission factor approaches based on country N inputs, as currently used in national emission inventories.

TI  - The role of land carbon sinks in mitigating global climate change
PY  - 2001
AB  - As evidence for the link between atmospheric greenhouse gases and climate change has increased, international efforts have focused on ways in which anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, can be reduced. However attempts to commit countries to reduce their emissions though the ratification of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol have been hampered by disagreement about the extent to which land carbon sinks should be considered in meeting these reduction commitments. The report highlights the considerable uncertainty in the scientific understanding of the causes, magnitude and permanence of the land carbon sink. While noting that the potential for human enhancement of the land carbon sink through changes in land management practices is finite in size and duration, it recommends that methods used in the production of forest and agricultural crops should be modified to reflect their short-term role in absorbing carbon dioxide. Reform of the European Unions Common Agricultural Policy could provide one opportunity to achieve this on agricultural land in Europe. With respect to the inclusion of land carbon sinks in the Kyoto Protocol, the report expresses concern that measurement techniques currently available are not sufficiently accurate to permit the reliable monitoring of any land carbon sinks that may be designated as part of such international agreements. The report concludes that projects designed to enhance land carbon sinks should not be allowed to divert financial and political resources away from long-term solutions to the problem of reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, namely the reduction in the use of fossil fuels.

TI  - Crop yields over the first nine years of LTRAS, a long-term comparison of field crop systems in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract The Long-Term Research on Agricultural Systems (LTRAS) experiment has been monitoring the long-term effects of conventional and alternative practices on crop yields and soil properties since 1993, with a planned duration of 100 years. Data for the first 9 years are presented here. Ten, 2-year rotations, each with three 0.4 ha plots per phase of the rotation, range from low-input rainfed unfertilized wheat to high-input irrigated conventional and organic maize–tomato systems. For years 3–9, average yields of alternative (organic and green manure) systems were significantly lower than those of comparable conventional systems, except that there were no significant differences in average yields of tomato. Delayed seeding after a winter legume cover crop (LCC) limited maize yields. Yield trends over years were somewhat obscured by variability due to weather. Negative yield trends over years in unfertilized wheat controls were statistically significant, but only when data for the 9th year were included. Yield trends for organic maize were also significantly negative, but tomato yields in the same system showed a significant positive trend, as did yields of conventional maize. As this experiment continues, long-term trends in soil properties and processes could alter the magnitude or direction of trends seen to date.

TI  - Emissions of nitrous oxide from Irish arable soils: effects of tillage and reduced N input
PY  - 2009
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux measurements from an Irish spring barley field managed under conventional and reduced tillage and different N fertilizer applications at the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre were made for two consecutive seasons. The aim was to investigate the efficacy of reduced tillage and reduced N fertilizer on seasonal fluxes and emission factors of N2O and to study the relationship between crop yield and N-induced fluxes of N2O. The soil is classified as a sandy loam with a pH of 7.4 and a mean organic carbon and nitrogen content at 15 cm of 19 and 1.9 g kg−1 dry soil, respectively. Reduced tillage had no significant effect on N2O fluxes from soils or crop grain yield. Multiple regression analysis revealed that soil moisture and an interaction between soil moisture and soil nitrate are the main significant factors affecting N2O flux. The derived emission factor was 0.6% of the applied N fertilizer, approximately 50% of the IPCC default EF of 1.25% used by the Irish EPA to estimate GHG or the IPCC revised EF of 0.9%. This resulted in huge overestimations of 2,275 and 1,050 tonnes of N2O-N for using the old and revised IPCC default factors respectively. By reducing the applied nitrogen fertilizer by 50% compared to the normal field rate, N2O emissions could be reduced by 57% with no significant decrease on grain yield or quality. This was consistent over the 2 years of measurements.

TI  - Comparison of Models for Describing; Corn Yield Response to Nitrogen Fertilizer
PY  - 1990
AB  - Decisions concerning optimum rates of fertilization directly or indirectly involve fitting some type of model to yield data collected when several rates of fertilizer are applied. Although several different models are commonly used to describe crop yield response to fertilizers, it is seldom explained why one model is selected over others. The objective of the work reported here was to compare and evaluate several models (linear-plus-plateau, quadratic-plus-plateau, quadratic, exponential, and square root) commonly used for describing the response of corn (Zea mays L.) to N fertilizer. The evaluation involved 12 site-years of data, each having 10 rates of N appied preplanting. AH models fit the data equally well when evaluated by using the R² statistic. All models indicated similar maximum yields, but there were marked discrepancies among models when predicting economic optimum rates of fertilization. Mean (across all site-years) economic optimum rates of fertilization as indicated by the various models ranged from 128 to 379 kg N ha⁻¹ at a common fertilizer-to-corn price ratio. Statistical analyses indicated that the most commonly used model, the quadratic model, did not give a valid description of the yield responses and tended to indicate optimal rates of fertilization that were too high. The quadratic-plus-plateau model best described the yield responses observed in this study. The results clearly show that, especially amid increasing concerns about the economic and environmental effects of overfertilization, the renson for selecting one model over others deserves more attention thun it has received in the past.

AB  - Abstract Mixed responses of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes to reduced tillage/no-till are widely reported across soil types and regions. In a field experiment on a Danish sandy loam soil we compared N2O emissions during winter barley growth following five years of direct drilling (DD), reduced tillage (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Each of these tillage treatments further varied in respect to whether the resulting plot crop residues were retained (+Res) or removed (−Res). Sampling took place from autumn 2007 to the end of spring 2008. Overall N2O emissions were 27 and 26% lower in DD and RT, respectively, relative to N2O emissions from CT plots (P

TI  - The primary sources of carbon loss during the crop-establishment period in a subtropical Oxisol under contrasting tillage systems
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract The physical protection of mineralizable carbon (C) in aggregates has been identified as the primary mechanism of soil C stabilization. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that the disruption of aggregate by soil tillage is a key process driving C losses during the crop-establishment period. However, these findings are based on studies performed in temperate soils. Limited information is available for studies performed in subtropical and tropical soils, especially in Oxisols, which are rich in oxides that provides chemical C stabilization. This study was performed in southern Brazil in a long-term soil-management experiment carried out in a clay Typic Haplorthox in Cruz Alta (RS). During the 22nd year of the experiment, carbon dioxide (CO2–C) emissions, temperature, and soil moisture were intensively evaluated over a 21-day summer crop-establishment period using a closed infrared CO2-flux chamber. The cropping system investigated was an intensive crop rotation following the soil input of winter-cover crops (black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) + common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) under two contrasting tillage systems, conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT). The apparent contributions to CO2–C losses by resident soil C associated with aggregate disruption and recent crop-residue C input were assessed in treatments with crop-residue input (+R) and with crop-residue removed (−R). An exponential-decay model was used to fit the differences in CO2–C flux between CT − R and NT − R (apparent aggregate-disruption effect) and between CT + R and CT − R (apparent recent crop-residue C input effect). As expected, the CT + R showed an increase of 72% in CO2–C losses relative to NT + R. During the three-week crop-establishment period, crop-residue C input was the primary source of CO2–C emissions under CT. The CO2–C losses under CT were equivalent to 65% of the aboveground C input by winter cover crops, whereas this value decreased to 35% in NT. Exponential-decay modeling of the data for the first week showed that approximately 20% of the CO2–C losses under CT were related to the exposure of mineralizable resident soil C due by tillage operations. The analysis showed that this value decreased to only 2% for the three-week period. The CO2–C emissions exhibited a positive linear relationship with soil temperature and soil water-filled porosity under NT, but a similar relationship was found only with soil temperature under CT. For this Oxisol during the crop-establishment period, the physical aggregate disruption induced by long-term CT played a secondary role in CO2–C losses relative to the recent crop-residue C input from tillage operations.

TI  - Long-term trends in nitrous oxide emissions, soil nitrogen, and crop yields of till and no-till cropping systems.
PY  - 2006
AB  - No-till cropping can increase soil C stocks and aggregation but patterns of long-term changes in N 2 O emissions, soil N availability, and crop yields still need to be resolved. We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N 2 O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotations between 1989 and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO 3 - concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO 3 - concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m -2 yr -1 over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 ± 0.52 g N ha d -1 ) and no-till (3.63 ± 0.53 g N ha d -1 ) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO 2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N 2 O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs.

TI  - Headwater streams: neglected ecosystems in the EU Water Framework Directive. Implications for nitrogen pollution control
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve the “good status” of waters by 2015, through monitoring and control of human impacts on “bodies of surface water” (BSWs), discrete elements for quality diagnosis and management. Headwater streams, however, are frequently neglected as they are not usually recognised as BSW. This poses limitations for the management of river catchments, because anthropogenic impacts on headwaters can constrain the quality of downstream rivers. To illustrate this problem, we compared nitrate levels and land use pressures in a small agricultural catchment with those recorded in the catchment in which it is embedded (Ega), and in the Ebro River Basin (NE Spain) comprising both. Agriculture greatly influenced water nitrate concentration, regardless of the size of the catchments: R2 = 0.91 for headwater catchments (0.1–7.3 km2), and R2 = 0.82 for Ebro tributary catchments (223–3113 km2). Moreover, nitrate concentration in the outlet of a non-BSW small river catchment was similar to that of the greater downstream BSW rivers. These results are of interest since, despite representing 76% of the length of the Ega catchment hydrographical network, only 3.1% of the length of the headwater streams has been identified as BSWs. Human activities affecting headwater streams should therefore be considered if the 2015 objective of the WFD is to be achieved.

TI  - Nutrient evolution in soil and cereal yield under different fertilization type in dryland
PY  - 2009
AB  - Under semiarid conditions the response of crops to synthetic fertilizers is often reduced. Organic fertilizers can be used to provide a continuous source of nutrients for the crops. The soil nitrogen and crop yield in a rotation of durum wheat (Triticum durum)–fallow-barley (Hordeum vulgare)–vetch (Vicia sativa) were studied during 4 years when synthetic fertilizer (chemical), compost (organic) or no fertilizer (control) were applied in a field with high initial contents of soil NO3–N (> 400 kg N ha−1), phosphorus (22 mg kg−1) and potassium (> 300 mg kg−1). Changes in soil organic matter, phosphorus and potassium were also measured. During the crop period, chemical fertilization significantly increased the content of soil NO3–N in the first 0.30 m of soil with respect to organic fertilization and the control. The yield of wheat and barley was not increased after applying chemical or organic fertilizer with respect to the unfertilized plots. The estimated losses of nitrogen were similar for the three types of fertilization, as well as the uptake of nitrogen for the total biomass produced. The initial levels of organic matter and phosphorus were maintained, even in the plots that were not fertilized, while the potassium decreased slightly. Thus, the rotation and burying of crop residues were enough to maintain the crop yield and the initial content of nutrients.

TI  - Effect of Liquid Cattle Manure on Corn Yield, Composition, and Soil Properties
PY  - 2007
AB  - The effects of liquid dairy cattle (Bos taurus) manure on corn (Zea mays L.) yield and composition were studied in a 4-yr field experiment conducted under a Mediterranean environment. In addition, long-term impact of (8-yr) manure application on soil-available NO 3 -N, P, and K; organic C; Kjeldahl N; and salinity was investigated. Four treatments were established in plots, previously used for a similar 4-yr experiment with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Treatments were: (i) application of 80 Mg manure ha -1 yr -1 ; (ii) single application of the equivalent N-P as inorganic fertilization (260 kg N ha -1 yr -1 and 57 kg P ha -1 yr -1 ); (iii) identical to (ii), but with split N application; and (iv) no fertilization. Corn grain and silage yields, N-P-K plant concentration, and uptake were significantly increased by manure or inorganic fertilizer addition relative to the control. During the 4-yr corn experiment, the amounts of available NO 3 -N in the soil profile of manure plots were higher than control, but similar to both inorganic fertilization treatments. Manure application maintained the amounts of soil available NO 3 -N, P, and K at desirable levels, almost each year of the total 8-yr application. However, soil organic C and Kjeldahl N remained unchanged. At the end of the experiment, soil salinity below 30 cm was significantly increased on manure or inorganic fertilizer addition relative to the control, but at levels acceptable for most crops. In conclusion, soil application of liquid dairy cattle manure at a rate equivalent to the recommended inorganic fertilization can enhance corn yield and composition and maintain soil fertility at desirable levels, without increasing soil salinity at unacceptable levels.

TI  - Emissions of Nitrous Oxide and Carbon Dioxide
PY  - 2006
AB  - Innovative management practices are required to increase the efficiency of N fertilizer usage and to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from agricultural soils. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using conservation tillage and N fertilizer placement depth to reduce N 2 O and CO 2 emissions associated with corn (Zea mays L.) production on clay loam soils in Eastern Canada. A 3-yr field study was established on a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation with each phase of the rotation present every year. Investigations were focused on the corn phase of the rotation. The tillage treatments following winter wheat included fall moldboard plow tillage (15 cm depth), fall zone-tillage (21 cm width, 15 cm depth), and no-tillage. The N placement treatments were \"shallow\" placement of sidedress N (2-cm depth) and \"deep\" placement of sidedress N (10-cm depth). Nitrous oxide emissions were measured 53 times and CO 2 emissions were measured 43 times over three growing seasons using field-based sampling chambers. There was a significant tillage and N placement interaction on N 2 O emissions. Averaged over all three tillage systems and site-years, N 2 O emissions from shallow N placement (2.83 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) were 26% lower than deep N placement (3.83 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ). The N 2 O emissions were similar among the tillage treatments when N was placed in the soil at a shallow depth. However, when N was placed deeper in the soil (10 cm), the 3-yr average N 2 O emissions from zone-tillage (2.98 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) were 20% lower than from no-tillage (3.71 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) and 38% lower than those from moldboard plow tillage (4.81 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ). Tillage type and N placement depth did not affect CO 2 emissions (overall average = 5.80 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ). Hence, zone-tillage and shallow N placement depth reduced N 2 O emissions without affecting CO 2 emissions.

TI  - Quantification of the effects of contrasting crops in the development of soil structure: an organic conversion
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil structure can be greatly affected, and hence manipulated, by agricultural management practices, such as crop rotation. This study aims to illustrate how soil structure under a stockless organic system differed between contrasting crop types using quantified data derived from image analysis. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from five organic conversion strategies in the second year of conversion, during two contrasting seasons in 2001 and following one uniform crop (oats) grown on all the plots in 2004. The samples were impregnated and images of soil structure collected at selected depth intervals. The images were analysed for macroporosity, pore size distribution and pore-perimeter fractal dimension. Significant differences were found between treatments in terms of overall macroporosity (%) and average pore size (mm 2 ) in 2001. The red clover (Trifolium pratense) treatments had the highest soil macroporosity in 2001, but showed a dramatic drop in 2004 accompanied by a reduction in average pore size (mm 2 ). Pore-perimeter fractal dimensions for four of the five crop treatments in 2001 did not show significant differences. However, there was a significant decrease in the fractal dimensions in 2004, indicating the presence of pores with less rough and irregular pore boundaries following a uniform cereal crop. Benefits to soil structure and porosity from clover were large and significant but were not lasting.

TI  - Tillage effects on cassava (Manihot esculenta) production and some soil properties
PY  - 1990
AB  - Abstract Cassava is traditionally grown on tilled soils. Interest in reduced-tillage systems is increasing in the humid tropics due to erosion problems. A field study was conducted on a sandy clay loam Ultisol to compare cassava performance in three tillage systems effects on soil water and organic carbon content. Tillage treatments were: (1) ploughing, harrowing and ridging (conventional); (2) digger-made holes (minimum); (3) pushing the sharpened end of cassavs cuttigs directly into the soil (no-till). Tillage did not affect total biomass yields in the first year. In the second year, significant differences were obtained in the yield of tops but not of fresh roots. No-till and minimum tillage out-yielded the conventional system by 40% and 23%, respectively, in the yield of tops,. It was apparent that elimination of ploughing did not reduce total biomass yield. Soil moisture contents in no-till and minimum tillage were significantly higher ( P = 0.05) than in the conventional-tillage system. Conv organic carbon decresed significantly ( P = 0.01) over time in all tillage systems. Conventional tillage gave the highest reduction. Cassava may be grown successfully in reduced-tillage systems in Ultisols of the humid tropics.

TI  - Agricultural management impacts on soil organic carbon storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions
PY  - 2005
AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of changing agricultural land use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions. We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist>tropical dry>temperate moist>temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58 ± 0.12, or 58% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69 ± 0.13, temperate moist with 0.71 ± 0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82 ± 0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23 ± 0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17 ± 0.05, temperate moist was 1.16 ± 0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10 ± 0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emission factors for agricultural soils in Great Britain : the impact of soil water-filled pore space and other controlling variables
PY  - 2003
AB  - Measurements were made of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from N-fertilised ungrazed grassland and arable land at sites widely distributed across Great Britain during 1999–2001. The closed static chamber method was used throughout. Emissions varied widely throughout the year at each site, and between sites. Daily fluxes up to 1200 g N2O–N ha−1 d−1 were recorded. The highest annual flux was 27.6 kg N2O–N ha−1 at a grassland site in Wales, whereas the lowest, 1.7 kg N2O–N ha−1, occurred on a soil overlying chalk in southern England. The key factors affecting N2O emissions from agricultural soil were soil WFPS, temperature and soil NO3––N content. On grassland, rainfall (particularly around the time of N application), with its consequent effect on water-filled pore space (WFPS), was the main driving factor during the growing season. Annual emission factors (EFs), uncorrected for background emission, varied from 0.4 to 6.5% of the nitrogen (N) applied, covering a similar range for grassland to that found previously for sites restricted to Scotland. Continued monitoring at a grassland reference site near Edinburgh showed that annual EFs vary greatly from year to year, even with similar management, and that several years' data are required to produce a robust mean EF. The overall distribution of EFs in this and previous studies was log-normal. The EFs for small-grain cereals (and oilseed rape) peaked at a much lower value than those for grassland, whereas the values for leafy vegetables and potato crops fitted well into the grassland distribution. These differences in EF between various types of crop should be taken into account when compiling regional or national N2O emission inventories.

TI  - Impacts of different N management regimes on nitrifier and denitrifier communities and N cycling in soil microenvironments
PY  - 2010
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays, targeting part of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), and 16S rRNA genes were coupled with 15 N pool dilution techniques to investigate the effects of long-term agricultural management practices on potential gross N mineralization and nitrification rates, as well as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), denitrifier, and total bacterial community sizes within different soil microenvironments. Three soil microenvironments [coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM; >250 mm), microaggregate (53e250 mm), and silt-and-clay fraction (<53 mm)] were physically isolated from soil samples collected across the cropping season from conventional, low-input, and organic maizeetomato systems (Zea mays L.eLycopersicum esculentum L.). We hypothesized that (i) the higher N inputs and soil N content of the organic system foster larger AOB and denitrifier communities than in the conventional and low-input systems, (ii) differences in potential gross N mineralization and nitrification rates across the systems correspond with AOB and denitrifier abundances, and (iii) amoA, nosZ, and 16S rRNA gene abundances are higher in the microaggregates than in the cPOM and silt-and-clay microenvironments. Despite 13 years of different soil management and greater soil C and N content in the organic compared to the conventional and low-input systems, total bacterial communities within the whole soil were similar in size across the three systems (w5.15 � 10

TI  - Mediterranean limnology: current status, gaps and the future
PY  - 2005
AB  - The current ecosystem paradigm in limnology is represented by the cold temperate, stratifying lake and the single-channelled river. However, the variety of inland water ecosystems is much higher, and so is the ecological complexity of many of them. Most Mediterranean limnosystems are quite distinct from the contemporary limnological paradigm. This overview will deal with the striking and exciting differences between Mediterranean and other temperate limnosystems. For example, most are very small, their catchment area is much larger than their size, and they experience both a longer vegetation period and a strong seasonality in water supply which occurs outside the hot season, often from groundwater sources. In addition, we encourage research on the often poorly known limnological processes taking place in Mediterranean regions by pointing at insufficiently covered research fields. Furthermore, competition for water among different users, arising from population increase in fertile and/or tourist areas, is certainly limiting the ability of many Mediterranean limnosystems to survive at present and in the near future, particularly in the face of the harsher environmental conditions that climatic change is triggering. A new paradigm on Mediterranean limnology is thus necessary. This will enable us to predict and mitigate more accurately the unstoppable effects of man-made change in these beautiful and still largely ignored ecosystems.

TI  - Replacing bare fallow with cover crops in a maize cropping system: Yield, N uptake and fertiliser fate
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Cover crops in dry regions have been often limited by low nutrient and water-use efficiency. This study was conducted during 3.5 years to determine the effect of replacing bare fallow by a cover crop on yield, N uptake, and fate of labeled fertiliser in an intensive maize production system. Three treatments were studied: barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), vetch ( Vicia villosa L.) and bare fallow during the intercropping period of maize ( Zea mays L.). All treatments were irrigated and fertilised following the same procedure, and a microplot in each plot was established with 210 kg N ha −1 of double labeled ammonium nitrate. Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N (N min ), and recovery of 15 N in plant and soil were determined after maize harvest and killing the cover crop. Replacing bare fallow with cover crops did not affect subsequent maize yield but affected N uptake. Vetch increased N supply by legume residues after the second year, and the N content in grain by the third. Nitrogen recover from fertiliser was not affected by treatment and averaged 46%. Barley recovered more 15 N during the autumn–winter period than vetch or fallow. Under representative conditions, average barley N content was 47, vetch 51, and spontaneous vegetation content 0.8 kg N ha −1 . Recovery of 15 N in barley comprised 19% of total N content in aerial biomass, while only 4% in vetch. Vetch enhaced soil 15 N recovery more than other treatments, suggesting its presence in a fairly stable organic fraction unavailable for maize uptake or lost. Replacing bare fallow by a cover crop only reduced fertiliser losses in a year with abundant precipitation. Nevertheless, reduction in soil N min in vetch and bare fallow treatments was similar, showing that N losses can be reduced in this cropping system, either by replace bare fallow with barley or smaller N fertiliser applicationto maize.

TI  - Preliminary estimates of the potential for carbon mitigation in European soils through no‐till farming
PY  - 1998
AB  - In this paper we estimate the European potential for carbon mitigation of no-till farming using results from European tillage experiments. Our calculations suggest some potential in terms of (a) reduced agricultural fossil fuel emissions, and (b) increased soil carbon sequestration. We estimate that 100% conversion to no-till farming would be likely to sequester about 23 Tg C y(-1) in the European Union or about 43 Tg C y(-1) in the wider Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union). In addition, up to 3.2 Tg C y(-1) could be saved in agricultural fossil fuel emissions. Compared to estimates of the potential for carbon sequestration of other carbon mitigation options, no-till agriculture shows nearly twice the potential of scenarios whereby soils are amended with organic materials. Our calculations suggest that 100% conversion to no-till agriculture in Europe could mitigate all fossil fuel-carbon emissions from agriculture in Europe. However, this is equivalent to only about 4.1% of total anthropogenic CO2-carbon produced annually in Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union) which in turn is equivalent to about 0.8% of global annual anthropogenic CO2-carbon emissions.

TI  - Emission of carbon dioxide from soil
PY  - 2002
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is an important greenhouse gas accounting for 60% of the total greenhouse effect. Soil is a major source for atmospheric CO 2 . In the event of growing threats of global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, reducing CO 2 emission by sequestering C in the soil is of prime importance. Soil management practices like increasing soil organic carbon content, reduced tillage, manuring, residue incorporation, improving soil biodiversity, micro-aggregation and mulching can play an important role in sequestering C in soil.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes following tillage and wetting in a wheat-fallow cropping system
PY  - 1998
AB  - Little is known about the relative contributions of episodic tillage and precipitation events to annual greenhouse gas emissions from soil. Consequently, the authors measured carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}), nitrous oxide (N{sub 2}O), and methane (CH{sub 4}) fluxes from soil in a wheat-fallow cropping system in western Nebraska using vented surface chambers, before and immediately after tillage and wetting with 5.1 cm of water, during the fallow period in 1995/1996. Replicated fallow management treatments included no-tillage, subtillage, and plow representing a wide range in degree of soil disturbance. Soil bulk density, water-filled pore space, electrical conductivity (EC{sub 1:1}), nitrate (NO{sub 3}), and pH within the top 30.5 cm soil, and soil temperature at 0 to 7.6 cm were measured to assess their correlation with variations in gas flux and tillage and wetting. Atmospheric concentrations above the soil (at {approximately} 40 cm) increased by 15% for CO{sub 2} and 9 to 31% for N{sub 2}O and 6 to 16% for CH{sub 4} within 1 min after tillage and returned to background concentrations within 2 h. Except immediately after tillage, net CH{sub 4} flux was negative, from the atmosphere into soil, and is referred to as CH{sub 4} uptake. Overall, increases (1.5--4-fold) inmore » CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O losses from soil, and CH{sub 4} uptake by soil were short lived and returned to background levels within 8 to 24 h after tillage. Losses of CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O increased to 1.7 and 5 times background emissions, respectively, for 24 h following wetting, while CH{sub 4} uptake declined by about 60% for 3 to 14 d after wetting. Water-filled pore space in the surface soil fell below 60% within 24 h after saturation and exhibited an inverse relationship (R{sup 2} = 0.66) with CH{sub 4} uptake. A significant decline in soil NO{sub 3} and EC{sub 1:1} in the top 7.6 cm occurred following wetting. Under the experimental conditions, and the expected frequency of tillage and wetting events, failure to include these short-lived episodic gas pulses in annual flux estimations may underestimate annual CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O loss up to 13 and 24%, respectively, and overestimate CH{sub 4} uptake by up to 18% in this cropping system.« less

TI  - The contribution of agricultural practices to nitrous oxide emissions in semi-arid Mali
PY  - 2008
AB  - The yield and flux of nitrous oxide (N2O) emitted from continuous cereals (with and without urea),
legumes ⁄ cereal in rotation and cereal ⁄ legume in rotation all with or without organic manure was monitored
from January 2004 to February 2005. All treatments except continuous cereals had phosphate
added. The cereal grown July–October in 2003 and 2004 was pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and the
legume was a bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The 10 m · 10 m plots were established in a semi-arid climate
in Mali. The addition of organic manure and both inorganic fertilizers increased yield and N2O emissions.
Continuous cereals treated with both organic manure and urea emitted significantly less N2O
(882 g N⁄ ha per year) than plots receiving no organic manure(1535 g N⁄ ha per year). Growing N-fixing
crops in rotation did not significantly increase N2O emissions. This study supports the new practice of
growing cereal and legumes in rotation as an environmentally sustainable system in semi-arid Mali

TI  - Dissolved and water-extractable organic matter in soils: a review on the influence of land use and management practices
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Despite that dissolved organic matter (DOM) and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) represent only a small part of soil organic matter, they appear to be involved in many soil processes. This review intends to compile the current information on the influence of land use and management practices on soil DOM and WEOM, and to identify the gaps in our knowledge that sometimes preclude from drawing general conclusions. The literature on DOM and WEOM dynamics in different ecosystems is derived mainly from studies on temperate forest soils. Although less abundant, literature on temperate grassland and arable soils is also available, whereas very few studies have been published on tropical ecosystems. Similarly, studies on DOM and WEOM have focused mainly on the carbon fraction, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus have received much less attention. On the short term, temporal and spatial variations in DOM and WEOM are complex and influenced by environmental conditions. Laboratory studies have shown that management practices, such as liming and N fertilization, can induce marked fluctuations in DOM and WEOM. Under field conditions, however, the net effect of management practices often remains unclear because many soil properties, which can interact and counterbalance, are influenced at the same time. Changes in DOM and WEOM upon management practices are generally of short duration, whereas long-term effects are more related to vegetation type and to the amount of plant litter returned to the soil. So far, research on soil DOM and WEOM as influenced by land use and management practices has offered fragmented and sometimes contradictory information. It is concluded that the standardization of collection and extraction methods for DOM and WEOM measurements is crucial to reduce the uncertainty when comparing results from different studies. More research would also be required (i) under field conditions and especially in tropical ecosystems, (ii) to determine the biological significance of measured fluctuations in DOM and WEOM concentration and composition, and (iii) to elucidate the mechanisms determining DOM/WEOM dynamics following changes in land use and management practices.

TI  - Agricultural use of three (sugar-beet) vinasse composts: effect on crops and chemical properties of a Cambisol soil in the Guadalquivir river valley (SW Spain)
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Disposal of concentrated beet-vinasse, a high-density syrupy waste from the sugar industry, constituted an environmental problem. Vinasse can be recycled as a fertiliser due to its high organic matter, N, and K contents. However, the direct application of vinasse is constrained by its high salinity (EC 250–300 dS m −1 ; Na 28 g kg −1 ) and high density (1.3 g cm −3 ). These problems can be overcome by co-composting the vinasse with other solid wastes. A study was conducted in the Guadalquivir river valley, SW Spain, in Coria del Rio, Seville. Three mixtures of a concentrated depotassified vinasse and solid wastes were co-composted in static windrows. The composts obtained were used in field experiments to study the effect of their application as deep fertiliser on three crops: corn ( Zea mays L.); sugar-beet ( Beta vulgaris L.) and sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.). The effect on chemical properties of a Xerochrept (Cambisol) soil after 2 years of compost application and after a further year of residual effect was also studied. A treatment with traditional inorganic fertiliser (applied as deep fertilisation) and an unamended soil (Control) were used for comparison purposes. Generally, the application of composts or inorganic fertiliser significantly increased crop yield when compared with the Control treatment. At the end of the experimental period, soil oxidizable-C, total humic extract-C and humic acids-C contents significantly increased in soils treated with composts when compared with Control and inorganic fertiliser treatments. Organic fertilisation also increased the Kjeldahl-N content of the soil. A slight increase of soil salinity was observed both in the composts and in the inorganic fertiliser treatments. Nevertheless, this increase did not cause sodium hazard to the soil. Co-composting of vinasse with agricultural residues serves two objectives: disposal of wastes and recycling of waste components. Furthermore, vinasse composts can be used as an alternative to mineral fertilisers.

TI  - Application of DNDC biogeochemistry model to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from Italian agricultural areas at high spatial resolution.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Agriculture is responsible for 13.5% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ( IPCC, 2007 ), in particular accounting for more than 80% of global anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However uncertainties in GHG inventories are still high as biogeochemical cycles are strongly influenced by climatic and environmental conditions and also depend on local agricultural practices. In order to improve the GHG balance assessment in cropland, higher order methods (Tier 3) are recommended such as, for example, model applications at spatial level. In the present study, a GIS-model integration was performed with the aim of improving the national GHG inventory in Italy. The de-nitrification decomposition (DNDC) model, chosen due to its ability to simulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, has been tested against measured data coming from eddy-covariance stations and soil flux chambers (for CO2 and N2O fluxes) belonging to Carbo-Italy network. Despite the varying site specific parameters, the results confirmed the ability of the model to represent the real C balance in irrigated maize crop under both conventional and minimum tillage. Modelled N2O emissions fitted the measured data well, but the corresponding emission factor from fertilizers was much lower than the IPCC default (0.008 vs 0.0125 kg N2O-N kg−1 N, respectively). A platform of simulation was then built to run DNDC for the entire national territory, linking the model with geographical databases. To implement the model, a high spatial resolution grid (1 km × 1 km) was adopted in order to develop a tool that could be used by local administrations and easily upload information at high spatial resolution (e.g. remote sensed information). A tree management (e.g. a combination of different management and land use) was also built to simulate crops with a ‘business as usual’ (BaU) scenario and with alternative management practices (AMP) and potentially create infinite combinations in each cell simply by varying a relative land use weight. Although the total area under agriculture has not been simulated so far, this platform of simulation appears promising to improve the national GHG inventory and derive C credits from the agricultural sector.

TI  - A review of conservation tillage strategies for humid temperate regions
PY  - 1994
AB  - The development of conservation tillage in sub-humid to semi-arid climates originated from the need to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion. Descriptions of conservation tillage in the above climatic zones are generally based upon the degree of soil surface residue cover. There is a need, however, to characterize conservation tillage for humid temperate climates, especially those with a cool season, subject to excessive precipitation and high levels of crop residue. Appropriate conservation tillage practices for such regions may make judicious use of cultivation to address soil and climatic constraints, and use tillage for straw incorporation to avoid the adverse effects of excessive crop residues on the growth of the following crop. Interaction between soil type and precipitation, in humid climates, emphasizes the need to group soil or land resources according to soil tillage requirement. Major attributes of conservation tillage in humid climates would be the continuum of live soil cover especially in the non-crop period, use of mulches and residue incorporation, and speed and efficiency of crop establishment. These attributes can be achieved through minimum tillage, rotational tillage, and attention to tillage timing. Besides their ability to conserve soil, conservation tillage practices in humid regions should also address farming system sustainability in terms of energy conservation and nutrient management.

TI  - Cover crops and cultivation: Impacts on soil N dynamics and microbiological function in a Mediterranean vineyard agroecosystem
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Impacts of cover crops, tillage and abiotic factors on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics, greenhouse gas emissions, and microbiological functions were investigated in a vineyard in California's Mediterranean climate. Treatments had been established in fall 2001 and were composed of two cover crops [Trios 102 ( Triticale  ×  Triosecale ), (‘Trios’), Merced Rye ( Secale cereale ), (‘Rye’)] and cultivation (‘Cultivation’). Soils were sampled every 2–3 weeks from November 2005 to November 2006. Effects of season and treatment on potential nitrification and denitrification also were determined. Gravimetric water content (GWC) reflected winter and spring rainfall, and soil temperature generally did not differ among treatments. Microbial biomass N (MBN) typically was 2–3-fold greater in ‘Rye’ and ‘Trios’ than ‘Cultivation’ in winter and spring, but these differences among treatments disappeared in summer. Soil nitrate (NO 3 − –N) was consistently greater in cultivated soils, with little temporal change in any treatment. In contrast, soil ammonium (NH 4 + –N) in cover crop treatments was 2–3-fold greater than ‘Cultivation’ in winter and spring, increasing in all treatments in summer after cover crops had been mowed and ‘Cultivation’ had been tilled. Significant multiple linear regressions of MBN on GWC, soil temperature, NH 4 + –N and NO 3 − –N for all treatments indicated that GWC significantly explained changes in MBN. Soil temperature also was significant for ‘Trios’ only, but its standard coefficient value was low, indicating its lesser importance in determining MBN. Despite a significant multiple linear regression of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) efflux on GWC, soil temperature, NH 4 + –N and NO 3 − –N in ‘Trios’ only, no single variate explained the observed variation. However, increases in N 2 O were detected after both cultivation and increases in GWC from precipitation in winter, late spring, and fall. Mean daily N 2 O efflux was greater in cover crops, but annual N 2 O efflux was low as compared to fertilized and unfertilized annual cropping systems. Potential nitrification, N mineralization and denitrification were generally 2–4-fold greater in cover crop treatments than ‘Cultivation’. Thus, cover crops enhanced the soil's capacity for supporting greater MBN, potential N mineralization, and the microbiological functions of nitrification and denitrification. Also, N dynamics appear to be more sensitive to changes in soil water content than temperature. We suggest that potential impacts of greater N 2 O emissions from cover crop soils be evaluated with reference to other benefits of cover cropping, such as increased soil organic matter content, improved microbiological activity, and N availability.

TI  - Soil Carbon Levels in Irrigated Western Corn Belt Rotations
PY  - 2008
AB  - Proposals promoting the use of massive amounts of crop residues and other lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production have increased the need for evaluation of the sustainability of cropping practices and their effect on environment quality. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of crop rotation and N fertilizer management and their stover production characteristics on soil organic carbon (SOC) levels in a long-term high-yielding irrigated study in the western Corn Belt. An irrigated monoculture corn (Zea mays L.), monoculture soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and soybean-corn cropping systems study was initiated in 1991 on a uniform site in the Platte Valley near Shelton, NE. Soil samples were collected in 1991 before initiation of the study and in the spring of 2005 and analyzed for SOC. Significant differences in total SOC values were obtained between rotations and N rates at the 0- to 7.5- and 0- to 15-cm depths in 2005 and all total SOC values were equal to or greater than SOC values obtained in 1991. Residue production was greater than 6 Mg ha -1 , a level that appears to be sufficient to maintain SOC levels, in all systems. Can residue amounts above this level be harvested sustainably for biofuel production in cropping systems similar to these? Though these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested without reducing SOC under the conditions of this investigation, the direct impact of stover removal remains to be evaluated.

TI  - Cattle selected for lower residual feed intake have reduced daily methane production.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Seventy-six Angus steers chosen from breeding lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were studied to quantify the relationship between RFI and the daily rate of methane production (MPR). A 70-d feeding test using a barley-based ration was conducted in which the voluntary DMI, feeding characteristics, and BW of steers were monitored. The estimated breeding value (EBV) for RFI (RFI(EBV)) for each steer had been calculated from 70-d RFI tests conducted on its parents. Methane production rate (g/d) was measured on each steer using SF(6) as a tracer gas in a series of 10-d measurement periods. Daily DMI of steers was lower during the methane measurement period than when methane was not being measured (11.18 vs. 11.88 kg; P = 0.001). A significant relationship existed between MPR and RFI when RFI (RFI(15d)) was estimated over the 15 d when steers were harnessed for methane collection (MPR = 13.3 x RFI(15d) + 179; r(2) = 0.12; P = 0.01). Animals expressing lower RFI had lower daily MPR. The relationship established between MPR and RFI(15d) was used to calculate a reduction in daily methane emission of 13.38 g accompanied a 1 kg/d reduction in RFI(EBV) in cattle consuming ad libitum a diet of 12.1 MJ of ME/kg. The magnitude of this emission reduction was between that predicted on the basis of intake reduction alone (18 g x d(-1) x kg of DMI(-1)) and that predicted by a model incorporating steer midtest BW and level of intake relative to maintenance (5 g x d(-1) x kg of DMI(-1)). Comparison of data from steers exhibiting the greatest (n = 10) and lowest (n = 10) RFI(15d) showed the low RFI(15d) group to not only have lower MPR (P = 0.017) but also reduced methane cost of growth (by 41.2 g of CH(4)/kg of ADG; P = 0.09). Although the opportunity to abate livestock MPR by selection against RFI seems great, RFI explained only a small proportion of the observed variation in MPR. A genotype x nutrition interaction can be anticipated, and the MPR:RFI(EBV) relationship will need to be defined over a range of diet types to account for this.

TI  - Short-term soil CO2 emission after conventional and reduced tillage of a no-till sugar cane area in southern Brazil
PY  - 2006
AB  - The impact of tillage systems on soil CO2 emission is a complex issue as different soil types are managed in various ways, from no-till to intensive land preparation. In southern Brazil, the adoption of a new management option has arisen most recently, with no-tillage as well as no burning of crops residues left on soil surface after harvesting, especially in sugar cane areas. Although such practice has helped to restore soil carbon, the tillage impact on soil carbon loss in such areas has not been widely investigated. This study evaluated the effect of moldboard plowing followed by offset disk harrow and chisel plowing on clay oxisol CO2 emission in a sugar cane field treated with no-tillage and high crop residues input in the last 6 years. Emissions after tillage were compared to undisturbed soil CO2 emissions during a 4-week period by using an LI-6400 system coupled to a portable soil chamber. Conventional tillage caused the highest emission during almost the whole period studied, except for the efflux immediately following tillage, when the reduced plot produced the highest peak. The lowest emissions were recorded 7 days after tillage, at the end of a dry period, when soil moisture reached its lowest rate. A linear regression between soil CO2 effluxes and soil moisture in the no-till and conventional plots corroborate the fact that moisture, and not soil temperature, was a controlling factor. Total soil CO2 loss was huge and indicates that the adoption of reduced tillage would considerably decrease soil carbon dioxide emission in our region, particularly during the summer season and when growers leave large amounts of crop residues on the soil surface. Although it is known that crop residues are important for restoring soil carbon, our result indicates that an amount equivalent to approximately 30% of annual crop carbon residues could be transferred to the atmosphere, in a period of 4 weeks only, when conventional tillage is applied on no-tilled soils.

TI  - Soils, a sink for N2O? A review
PY  - 2007
AB  - Soils are the main sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The N2O emission at the soil surface is the result of production and consumption processes. So far, research has concentrated on net N2O production. However, in the literature, there are numerous reports of net negative fluxes of N2O, (i.e. fluxes from the atmosphere to the soil). Such fluxes are frequent and substantial and cannot simply be dismissed as experimental noise.

Net N2O consumption has been measured under various conditions from the tropics to temperate areas, in natural and agricultural systems. Low mineral N and large moisture contents have sometimes been found to favour N2O consumption. This fits in with denitrification as the responsible process, reducing N2O to N2. However, it has also been reported that nitrifiers consume N2O in nitrifier denitrification. A contribution of various processes could explain the wide range of conditions found to allow N2O consumption, ranging from low to high temperatures, wet to dry soils, and fertilized to unfertilized plots. Generally, conditions interfering with N2O diffusion in the soil seem to enhance N2O consumption. However, the factors regulating N2O consumption are not yet well understood and merit further study.

Frequent literature reports of net N2O consumption suggest that a soil sink could help account for the current imbalance in estimated global budgets of N2O. Therefore, a systematic investigation into N2O consumption is necessary. This should concentrate on the organisms, reactions, and environmental factors involved.

TI  - NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM CORN–SOYBEAN SYSTEMS IN THE MIDWEST
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil N2O emissions from three corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems in central Iowa were measured from the spring of 2003 through February 2005. The three managements systems evaluated were full-width tillage (fall chisel plow, spring disk), no-till, and no-till with a rye (Secale cereale L. ‘Rymin’) winter cover crop. Four replicate plots of each treatment were established within each crop of the rotation and both crops were present in each of the two growing seasons. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured weekly during the periods of April through October, biweekly during March and November, and monthly in December, January, and February. Two polyvinyl chloride rings (30-cm diameter) were installed in each plot (in and between plant rows) and were used to support soil chambers during the gas flux measurements. Flux measurements were performed by placing vented chambers on the rings and collecting gas samples 0, 15, 30, and 45 min following chamber deployment. Nitrous oxide fluxes were computed from the change in N2O concentration with time, after accounting for diffusional constraints. We observed no significant tillage or cover crop effects on N2O flux in either year. In 2003 mean N2O fluxes were 2.7, 2.2, and 2.3 kg N2O-N ha 21 yr 21 from the soybean plots under chisel plow, no-till, and no-till 1 cover crop, respectively. Emissions from the chisel plow, no-till, and no-till 1 cover crop plots planted to corn averaged 10.2, 7.9, and 7.6 kg N2O-N ha 21 yr 21 , respectively. In 2004 fluxes from both crops were higher than in 2003, but fluxes did not differ among the management systems. Fluxes from the corn plots were significantly higher than from the soybean plots in both years. Comparison of our results with estimates calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default emission factor of 0.0125 indicate that the estimated fluxes underestimate measured emissions by a factor of 3 at our sites.

TI  - Effects of long-term tillage and drainage treatments on greenhouse gas fluxes from a corn field during the fallow period
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract Advance tillage research suggests that tillage decreases soil fertility and adversely affects the environment. The objective of this research was to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) flux vis-a-vis GHG production potential at different soil depths (0–100 cm) from tillage and drainage management treatments during the fallow period (October 2009 to April 2010) in a continuous (since 1994) corn ( Zea mays ) growing field at the Waterman farm in central Ohio. The Crosby silt loam ( Aeric ochraqualf ) soil of the experimental farm has been managed with the same practice since 1994 with two tillage sub-factors: no till (NT) and chisel tillage (T) and two drainage sub-factors: tile drainage (D) and no-drainage (ND). The fallow period was from the middle of October to the middle of April. The field was under snow cover during the middle of December to the first week of March. GHG fluxes (CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O) were significantly lower during the snow cover period. This study suggests that the CO 2 flux was significantly higher from T and D plots compared to NT and ND plots. Neither CH 4 nor N 2 O fluxes were influenced by tillage or drainage. The CO 2 flux from T + D treatments was significantly higher (25.98–398.65 mg m −2  h −1 ) throughout the fallow period. Significantly higher N 2 O flux (87.07–125.76 μg m −2  h −1 ) was recorded from all treatments during the thawing period in the first week of March. Considering that the total C flux involves only the loss from the SOC stock, as much as 3.05% of the total SOC stock (1.23 Mg C ha −1 ) was lost during the fallow period from T–D plots as CO 2 and CH 4 . Analysis of soil from different soil depths suggests that the CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from soil were mostly dependent on production potential at 0–10 cm and 0–30 cm of soil depths, respectively. However, there was no such trend for CH 4 emissions from soil.

TI  - Comparison of the Efficiency and Use of Energy in Organic and Conventional Farming in Spanish Agricultural Systems
PY  - 2010
AB  - The use of non-renewable energy in farming, a factor which considerably reduces its energy efficiency, continues to increase. Moreover, there is growing worldwide concern regarding the emission of greenhouse gases and their effect on our climate, which is directly related to the use of fossil energy. All this creates a need for energy studies on changing tendencies in the management of agricultural systems, among which we find that of organic farming. This article uses energy balances to evaluate the contribution of organic farming to the increase of energy efficiency in Spanish agriculture. To achieve this objective, comparative studies were carried out on 78 organic crops and their conventional counterparts. Primary data were obtained via direct surveys carried out at farms distributed across the whole of Spain. The results indicate that non-renewable energy efficiency is higher in organic farming, whilst the consumption of this type of energy is lower. For this reason, although certain qualifications a...

TI  - Carbon sequestration in tropical grassland ecosytems - Carbon sequestration in tropical grassland ecosystems
PY  - 2007
AB  - The increasing scientific consensus on global warming, together with the precautionary principle and the fear of non-linear climate transitions is leading to increasing action to mitigate global warming. To help mitigate global warming, carbon storage by forests is often mentioned as the only or the best way to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. This book presents evidence that tropical grasslands, which cover 50% of the earth’s surface, are as important as forests for the sequestration of carbon. Results are reported of a large five year on-farm research project carried out in Latin America (Colombia, Costa Rica). Soil and vegetation carbon stocks of long-established pasture, fodder bank and silvopastoral systems on commercial farms were compared with those of adjacent forest and degraded land. The objective was to identify production systems that both increase livestock productivity and farm income and, at the same time, contribute to a reduction of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. The project was carried out in four ecosystems: the Andean hillsides of the semi-evergreen forest in Colombia; the Colombian humid Amazonian tropical forest ecosystem; the sub-humid tropical forest ecosystem on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica; and the humid tropical forest ecosystem on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica.

TI  - Effect of condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus on the nutritive value of pasture for sheep
PY  - 1997
AB  - The extent to which condensed tannins (CT) in Lotus corniculatus were able to affect protein degradation and the nutritive value of pasture were evaluated at Palmerston North, New Zealand in 1992 in an indoor feeding trial with sheep and using in vitro incubations. The feeding trial involved three groups of seven young wether sheep held indoors in metabolism crates for the 32-day experimental period with one group fed freshly cut ryegrass/clover pasture (Pasture group) whilst the other two groups received a mixture of c . 37% freshly cut Lotus corniculatus and 63% pasture (dry matter (DM) basis). One of the latter groups was given twice daily oral drenches of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to bind with and remove the effects of the CT (PEG group) whilst the remaining sheep (Tannin group) were not drenched. Intakes of sheep given the mixed diets were constrained to that of the pasture group. The CT concentration in the lotus was 26·1 g/kg DM so that the mixed diets contained c . 10g CT/kg DM. Effects of CT on digestion and sheep performance were minimal. Apparent digestibility of N was lower in the Tannin group (76·4%) than PEG (79·8%) or Pasture (79·4%) sheep ( P <0·001), but there were no differences in DM digestibility (75%) or wool growth from mid-side patches. Rumen ammonia and soluble protein concentrations appeared to be similar in PEG and Tannin sheep and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were similar in all groups (100 mmol/l). For incubations in vitro , several ratios of Lotus corniculatus : pasture were used to determine the effects of CT on precipitation of soluble proteins and the net yield of ammonia and gas with and without PEG. Homogenates of Lotus corniculatus leaves and pasture showed that 50% of soluble protein was precipitated by 1·3% CT in homogenate DM and there was a substantial decrease in in vitro degradation to ammonia when lotus leaf accounted for 33% or more of DM with pasture. This work emphasises the need for caution when extrapolating from in vitro to the in vivo situation and suggests that 1% CT from Lotus corniculatus may be insufficient to affect the nutritive value of fresh forages for sheep.

TI  - Review of greenhouse gas emissions from crop production systems and fertilizer management effects
PY  - 2009
AB  - Fertilizer nitrogen (N) use is expanding globally to satisfy food, fiber, and fuel demands of a growing world population. Fertilizer consumers are being asked to improve N use efficiency through better management in their fields, to protect water resources and to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while sustaining soil resources and providing a healthy economy. A review of the available science on the effects of N source, rate, timing, and placement, in combination with other cropping and tillage practices, on GHG emissions was conducted. Implementation of intensive crop management practices, using principles of ecological intensification to enhance efficient and effective nutrient uptake while achieving high yields, was identified as a principal way to achieve reductions in GHG emissions while meeting production demands. Many studies identified through the review involved measurements of GHG emissions over several weeks to a few months, which greatly limit the ability to accurately determine system-level management effects on net global warming potential. The current science indicates: (1) appropriate fertilizer N use helps increase biomass production necessary to help restore and maintain soil organic carbon (SOC) levels; (2) best management practices (BMPs) for fertilizer N play a large role in minimizing residual soil nitrate, which helps lower the risk of increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions; (3) tillage practices that reduce soil disturbance and maintain crop residue on the soil surface can increase SOC levels, but usually only if crop productivity is maintained or increased; (4) differences among fertilizer N sources in N2O emissions depend on site- and weather-specific conditions; and (5) intensive crop management systems do not necessarily increase GHG emissions per unit of crop or food production; they can help spare natural areas from conversion to cropland and allow conversion of selected lands to forests for GHG mitigation, while supplying the world's need for food, fiber, and biofuel. Transfer of the information to fertilizer dealers, crop advisers, farmers, and agricultural and environmental authorities should lead to increased implementation of fertilizer BMPs, and help to reduce confusion over the role of fertilizer N on cropping system emissions of GHGs. Gaps in scientific understanding were identified and will require the collaborative attention of agronomists, soil scientists, ecologists, and environmental authorities in serving the immediate and long-term interests of the human population.

TI  - Total soil C and N sequestration in a grassland following 10 years of free air CO2 enrichment
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil C sequestration may mitigate rising levels of atmospheric CO2. However, it has yet to be determined whether net soil C sequestration occurs in N-rich grasslands exposed to long-term elevated CO2. This study examined whether N-fertilized grasslands exposed to elevated CO2 sequestered additional C. For 10 years, Lolium perenne, Trifolium repens, and the mixture of L. perenne/T. repens grasslands were exposed to ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (35 and 60Pa pCO2). The applied CO2 was depleted in d 13 C and the grasslands received low (140kgha � 1 ) and high (560kgha � 1 ) rates of 15 N-labeled fertilizer. Annually collected soil samples from the top 10cm of the grassland soils allowed us to follow the sequestration of new C in the surface soil layer. For the first time, we were able to collect dual-labeled soil samples to a depth of 75cm after 10 years of elevated CO2 and determine the total amount of new soil C and N sequestered in the whole soil profile. Elevated CO2, N-fertilization rate, and species had no significant effect on total soil C. On average 9.4Mg new Cha � 1 was sequestered, which corresponds to 26.5% of the total C. The mean residence time of the C present in the 0‐10cm soil depth was calculated at 4.6 � 1.5 and 3.1 � 1.1 years for L. perenne and T. repens soil, respectively. After 10 years, total soil N and C in the 0‐75cm soil depth was unaffected by CO2 concentration, Nfertilization rate and plant species. The total amount of 15 N-fertilizer sequestered in the 0‐75cm soil depth was also unaffected by CO2 concentration, but significantly more 15 N was sequestered in the L. perenne compared with the T. repens swards: 620 vs. 452kgha � 1 at the high rate and 234 vs. 133kgha � 1 at the low rate of N fertilization. Intermediate values of 15 N recovery were found in the mixture. The fertilizer derived N amounted to 2.8% of total N for the low rate and increased to 8.6% for the high rate of N application. On average, 13.9% of the applied 15 N-fertilizer was recovered in the 0‐75cm soil depth in soil organic matter in the L. perenne sward, whereas 8.8% was recovered under the T. repens swards, indicating that the N2-fixing T. repens system was less effective in sequestering applied N than the non-N2-fixing L. perenne system. Prolonged elevated CO2 did not lead to an increase in whole soil profile C and N in these fertilized pastures. The potential use of fertilized and regular cut pastures as a net soil C sink under longterm elevated CO2 appears to be limited and will likely not significantly contribute to the mitigation of anthropogenic C emissions.

TI  - Modelling annual pasture dynamics: Application to stomatal ozone deposition
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Modelling ozone (O 3 ) deposition for impact risk assessment is still poorly developed for herbaceous vegetation, particularly for Mediterranean annual pastures. High inter-annual climatic variability in the Mediterranean area makes it difficult to develop models characterizing gas exchange behaviour and air pollutant absorption suitable for risk assessment. This paper presents a new model to estimate stomatal conductance (g s ) of Trifolium subterraneum , a characteristic species of dehesa pastures. The MEDPAS (MEDiterranean PAStures) model couples 3 modules estimating soil water content (SWC), vegetation growth and g s . The g s module is a reparameterized version of the stomatal component of the EMEP DO 3 SE O 3 deposition model. The MEDPAS model was applied to two contrasting years representing typical dry and humid springs respectively and with different O 3 exposures. The MEDPAS model reproduced realistically the g s seasonal and inter-annual variations observed in the field. SWC was identified as the major driver of differences across years. Despite the higher O 3 exposure in the dry year, meteorological conditions favoured 2.1 times higher g s and 56 day longer growing season in the humid year compared to the dry year. This resulted in higher ozone fluxes absorbed by T. subterraneum in the humid year. High inter-family variability was found in gas exchange rates, therefore limiting the relevance of single species O 3 deposition flux modelling for dehesa pastures. Stomatal conductance dynamics at the canopy level need to be considered for more accurate O 3 flux modelling for present and future climate scenarios in the Mediterranean area.

TI  - The Effect of Wheat Straw, Corn Straw and Tobacco Residues on Denitrification Losses in a Field Planted with Wheat
PY  - 2002
AB  - A field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different organic residues (OR) (e.g., wheat straw corn straw and tobacco residues) on nitrogen mineralization and denitrification loss (N2O-N) using application rates recommended to local farmers. Nitrate and ammonium analyses were carried out on periodically collected soil samples. In-situ denitrification loss was determined using the acetylene inhibition technique (AIT). The results revealed that OR application increased N mineralization significantly. In the favorable conditions for nitrification and intensive mineralization period, NO3--N accumulation at 0-60 cm depth peaked at 163.0, 177.7 and 226.6 kg N ha-1 in plots with wheat straw, corn straw and tobacco waste, respectively. In-situ denitrification measurements showed that intensive mineralization, depending on temperature and humidity conditions, significantly increased denitrification losses. The denitrification values measured showed a variation between 7.58 and 17.40 kg N2O-N ha-1. The results also showed that the effect of organic substrates on N loss via denitrification was highly dependent on the type of organic substrate used, and the C/N ratio of the organic substrate played an important role in N loss by denitrification.

TI  - Analysis of changes in organic carbon in mineral soils across England and Wales using a simple single-pool model.
PY  - 2010
AB  - We use a simple single-pool model of soil carbon turnover to evaluate possible explanations for the widespread changes in the organic carbon contents of mineral soils across England and Wales, measured in the National Soil Inventory between 1978 and 2003. We provide a means of quantifying the changes in rates of soil organic carbon decomposition in relation to inputs from vegetation required to explain the results. We find that neither changes in decomposition resulting from the effects of climate change on soil temperature and moisture, nor changes in input, could by themselves account for the overall trends. Past changes in land use and management were more likely explanations. Any climate-change signal is masked by these other changes.

TI  - Climate change effects on soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions in Abies fabri forest of subalpine, southwest China
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Abies fabri forest on the eastern slope of the Gongga Mountain is a typical subalpine dark coniferous forest in southwestern China. The soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions in the A. fabri forest in future climates were simulated by the Forest-DNDC (denitrification-decomposition) model. Three future climate scenarios (B1, A1B and A2) predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were selectively investigated. The simulation showed that at elevated temperature and precipitation, the annual change of soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased in the forest floor pool but increased in the mineral soil pool. The increases in the CO(2), N(2)O and NO emissions from soil were also quantified. The results indicated that elevated temperature and precipitation influenced the soil carbon dynamics, and significantly increased the greenhouse gas emissions from the soil in the A. fabri forest of subalpine.

TI  - GM Crop Cultivation in Ireland: Ecological and Economic Considerations
PY  - 2005
AB  - Like many states in the European Union, Ireland has yet to fully commit itself to genetically modified (GM) crop technology. The general position of the Irish Government is ‘positive but precautionary’. However, with the European-wide de-facto moratorium on commercial production of GM crops now ended, many strategically important decisions regarding the commercial deployment of such crops and their co-existence with conventional/organic crops need to be considered. To date, little research on the environmental impact of GM crops has been carried out in Ireland, and the provision of relevant local information lags far behind that available in other countries in the European Union. In this paper, we discuss much of the new ecological and economic data that have emerged since the moratorium on GM crops was introduced in 1998, assess the likely impacts of pest-oriented GM crops should they be introduced to Ireland and examine criteria for post-release monitoring. We also describe the likely commercial demand for these crops and the consequent priorities for ecological research. We argue that the impact of GM technology needs to be assessed in relation to the environmental impact of modern agriculture as a whole. Public unease in relation to this technology may be addressed if adequate resources are made available for independent Irish research on the issue.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation potential from fertilizer manufacture and application in India
PY  - 2010
AB  - Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers, by both very energy-intensive manufacture and inefficient N use in farm soils, contribute rationally to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and, thus, climate change. India consumes ∼14Mt of synthetic N per year, of which about 80 per cent is produced, and is the second-largest producer and consumer in the world, after China. We estimate that GHG emissions from synthetic N fertilizer in India reached ∼100Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) in 2006/2007; about half of these emissions resulted from the 11Mt of synthetic N produced in the country that year (48Mt of CO2-e) and the other half resulted from the 14Mt of N applied to Indian farm soils in the same year (51Mt of CO2-e, ranging between 28 and 163Mt of CO2-e). Emissions from synthetic N fertilizers represent 6 per cent of India's total anthropogenic emissions, comparable to cement industry and to the whole road transport system. There is significant potential to mitigate these emissions: savings from increased...

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon and bioavailability of N and P as indicators of soil quality
PY  - 2005
AB  - Soil quality has become an important issue in soil science. Considerable attempts have been made to define soil quality, but a general concept has not yet been accepted by the scientific community. The selection of quantitative indices for soil quality is extremely difficult, and a considerable number of chemical, physical, and biochemical properties have been suggested as potential indicators of soil quality. Because soil organic matter (SOM) can be associated with different soil chemical, physical and biological processes, it has been widely considered as one of the best soil quality indicator. Land use can significantly influence dynamics of organic carbon and N, P, and S cycle. However, changes in total soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in response to land use may be difficult to detect because of the natural soil variability. In the short to medium term, biological properties and readily decomposable fractions of SOC, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), are much more sensitive to soil management than is SOM as a whole, and can be used as a key indicator of soil natural functions. Despite the fact that labile C accounts for a small portion of the total organic matter in the soils, DOC is the most mobile and important C-source for microorganisms, and can easily reflect the effects of land use on soil quality. Although several methods are used to characterize DOC, the factors influencing mineralization and bioavailability of elements associated with organic matter (N, P, and S) remains unclear. Future research should focus on the processes that govern DOC and nutrient dynamics and how they affect soil quality.

TI  - Effects of Casuarina equisetifolia Composted Litter and Ramial-Wood Chips on Tomato Growth and Soil Properties in Niayes, Senegal
PY  - 2002
AB  - ABSTRACT A field experiment was conducted to study the effects of ramial chipped wood (RCW) and litter compost (LC) of Casuarina equisetifolia on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) growth and soil properties in Niayes, Senegal. The RCW and LC were applied to a sandy soil at 10, 20 and 40 t ha−1 and compared with a control and recommended fertilizer mixture. Soil and plant samples were taken at 45 days of tomato growth and at harvest time for analysis. Residual effects of the materials were evaluated by establishing a second tomato crop on the same plots. Application of RCW depressed tomato growth and yield during the first cropping and this was attributed to RCW inducing intense N immobilization in the soil due its wide C:N ratio. Improvements in growth and yield were observed during the second cropping and ascribed to improved nitrogen release following the extended incubation of the RCW in the soil. In order to derive short-term benefits from RCW application, it should be applied in combination with exper...

TI  - Relationship between soil structure and runoff/soil loss after 24 years of conservation tillage
PY  - 2006
AB  - A better understanding of tillage and stubble management effects on surface soil structure is vital for the development of effective soil conservation practices for the long-term. Relationships between aspects of soil structure and runoff/soil loss were investigated in 24 year old field experiment on an Oxic Paleustalf, in NSW, Australia. Two tillage/stubble management systems were compared, namely direct drilled/stubble retained (DD/SR) versus conventional tillage/stubble burnt (CC/SB). Tillage and stubble burning significantly increased bulk density and decreased the macro-aggregate stability, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and total porosity, particularly macroporosity (>60 μm). For the 0–5 cm layer, DD/SR had significantly higher water stability of macro-aggregates >2 mm than CC/SB (165 g/kg versus 78 g/kg), and the volume of pore space of diameter >60 μm at 0–5 cm depth was significantly greater (more than 11%) for DD/SR than for CC/SB. Under simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) and the removal of surface stubble, both runoff and soil loss were significantly higher under CC/SB compared to DD/SR. The infiltration rate at the end of the experiment under DD/SR was 3.7 times that of CC/SB (85 mm/h versus 23 mm/h). There were significant correlations between the proportion of soil particles >0.25 mm measured after wetting by rain and both final infiltration rate (P < 0.001) and soil loss (P < 0.001). It was concluded that 24 years of direct drilling and stubble retained practices significantly reduced runoff and soil erosion hazards, due to a fundamental change in soil structure, viz. higher soil aggregate stability and higher macroporosity of the surface soil.

PY  - 2004
AB  - ABSTRACT Protected conventional and organic farming systems for watermelon and melon were compared over a two-year period in the Mediterranean Amik plain of southern Turkey. Yield, fruit quality and growth responses of the vegetable crops were measured and compared as a function of conventional management, and three composted sheep-cattle manure treatments of 6 kg m−2, 12 kg m−2 and 18 kg m−2. On average, total and marketable yields of watermelon and melon grown organically under low plastic tunnels showed a two-fold increase under the organic treatments of 12 kg m−2 and 18 kg m−2 relative to the protected conventional management system (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in watermelon and melon yields between the manure application levels of 12 and 18 kg m−2. There were significant changes in mean fruit weight and width between the control and the manure level of 18 kg m−2 for watermelon and in mean stem diameter between the control and the manure levels of 12 and 18 kg m−2 for melon (p < 0.0...

TI  - Tillage and seasonal emissions of CO2, N2O and NO across a seed bed and at the field scale in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 2009
AB  - Whereas the contribution of agriculture to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is well known, especially of NOx gases following the application of N-fertilizer additions, quantitative estimates across fields remain uncertain. Here, we quantified CO2 ,N 2O, and NO emissions from an irrigated field under standard tillage and in a field recently converted (� 5 years) to minimum tillage in Yolo County, California, under a Mediterranean climate. We focused on the spatiotemporal variation of GHG emissions among positions across a seed bed and at the field scale. Seasonal CO2 and N2O fluxes ranged from 4.6 to 52.4 kg C ha � 1 day � 1 and 0 to 23.7 g N ha � 1 day � 1 , respectively. There was a significant seasonal pattern of CO2 emissions as a function of crop growth, while the level of CO2 flux rates varied annually by crop type and the previous year’s soil C inputs. The seasonal N2O emissions coincided with N fertilization placement and irrigation events. With the exception of immediately after N fertilizing, NO emissions were on average 2–33 times lower than N2O emissions. Whereas gross effects of tillage and position in the seed bed on CO2 and N2O emissions were not significant, the emissions were significantly different in a specific seed bed position because of an interaction between tillage and position in the seed bed. For example, N2O fluxes in the side dress position were significantly greater than fluxes from other seed bed positions, and were further accentuated by a significant tillage effect. At the field scale, soil-water content and temperature were generally related to both optimum CO2 and N2O emissions, but the relationships were highly variable. The results suggest that position-specific variations and interaction with tillage should be accounted for to improve the estimates of GHG emissions from irrigated soils.

TI  - Agricultural soils as a sink to mitigate CO2 emissions
PY  - 1997
AB  - Abstract. Agricultural soils, having been depleted of much of their native carbon stocks, have a significant CO2 sink capacity. Global estimates of this sink capacity are in the order of 20-30 Pg C over the next 50-100 years. Management practices to build up soil C must increase the input of organic matter to soil and/or decrease soil organic matter decomposition rates. The most appropriate management practices to increase soil C vary regionally, dependent on both environmental and socioeconomic factors.

In temperate regions, key strategies involve increasing cropping frequency and reducing bare fallow, increasing the use of perennial forages (including N-fixing species) in crop rotations, retaining crop residues and reducing or eliminating tillage (i.e. no-till). In North America and Europe, conversion of marginal arable land to permanent perennial vegetation, to protect fragile soils and landscapes and/or reduce agricultural surpluses, provides additional opportunities for C sequestration.

In the tropics, increasing C inputs to soil through improving the fertility and productivity of cropland and pastures is essential. In extensive systems with vegetated fallow periods (e.g. shifting cultivation), planted fallows and cover crops can increase C levels over the cropping cycle. Use of no-till, green manures and agroforestry are other beneficial practices. Overall, improving the productivity and sustainability of existing agricultural lands is crucial to help reduce the rate of new land clearing, from which large amounts of CO2 from biomass and soil are emitted to the atmosphere.

Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and sequestration potential have been performed, mainly for temperate industrialized countries. More are needed, especially for the tropics, to capture region-specific interactions between climate, soil and management resources that are lost in global level assessments.

By itself, C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only modest contributions (e.g. 3-6% of total fossil C emissions) to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, effective mitigation policies will not be based on any single ‘magic bullet’ solutions, but rather on many modest reductions which are economically efficient and which confer additional benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is a significant mitigation option. Additional advantages of pursuing strategies to increase soil C are the added benefits of improved soil quality for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.

TI  - ARE ORGANIC N FERTILIZING STRATEGIES ABLE TO IMPROVE LETTUCE YIELD, USE OF NITROGEN AND N STATUS?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Despite the importance of fertilizing practices in the crop yield improvement, nitrogen (N) utilization, and N status, their management by farmers is still rather empirical, especially when new organic materials are applied. Therefore, the aim of this research was to study the possible bio-products (anaerobic digestates and on-farm compost) applications and to evaluate their effects on lettuce performance, N efficiency and soil properties. The plant and soil N indicators were also investigated to reduce the N supply in lettuce production. To accomplish these objectives a three-year field experiment was carried out comparing the following N fertilization strategies: organic, with anaerobic digestates, based on stabilized wine distillery wastewater (SAD) and not stabilized wine distillery wastewater (NSAD) and on-farm compost, based on olive pomace compost (OPC); mineral (MIN), with ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate; mineral-organic, with a slow N release commercial fertilizer (CORG).

TI  - Soil tillage enhanced CO2 and N2O emissions from loamy sand soil under spring barley
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Soil tillage intensity can be expected to affect the greenhouse gas balance of arable cropping systems through effects on soil physics and biology affecting soil carbon storage and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. The effects of conventional tillage (CT) with ploughing to 20 cm, reduced tillage (RT) with harrowing to 8–10 cm and direct drilling (DD) on CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from a loamy sand soil (8.1% clay, 3.5% organic matter) under spring barley undersown with ryegrass were measured by static chambers over a period of 113 days in spring and summer 2004 in a tillage experiment established in 2002 at Foulum, Denmark. There was a high temporal and spatial variation in both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, which made the comparisons of treatment effects on emissions on single dates difficult. However, this variation was reduced when the measurements were corrected for diurnal variation in the emissions and when emissions were cumulated over a longer period. Both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions decreased in the order CT > RT > DD. Compared with CT (40 kg C day −1 ) the cumulated CO 2 emissions during the 91 days after tillage were 21 and 25% lower for the RT and the DD treatments, respectively. The cumulated N 2 O emission from CT over the entire observation period (0.89 kg N ha −1 or 7.9 g N day −1 ) was about twice that of DD. The N 2 O emissions were significantly higher for CT compared with DD and RT, even before tillage and the difference increased after tillage, but decreased after fertilisation. Spring barley dry matter grain yields were reduced by 14% for RT and 27% for DD compared to CT. Measurements of soil mineral nitrogen (N) at sowing showed no difference between the treatments, and could thus not explain the differences in N 2 O emissions and crop N uptake. It is likely that tillage affected CO 2 emissions, N 2 O emissions and crop growth through different processes, where effects of soil compactness on root penetration and soil aeration and diffusivity on one side and soil organic matter turnover on the other side probably played key roles.

TI  - Soil carbon saturation: concept, evidence and evaluation
PY  - 2007
AB  - Current estimates of soil C storage potential are based on models or factors that assume linearity between C input levels and C stocks at steady-state, implying that SOC stocks could increase without limit as C input levels increase. However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state SOC stock with increasing C input levels suggesting that SOC can become saturated with respect to C input. We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in C input levels to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil C and C input used to model SOM dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in C input levels were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level. We conclude that the saturation of soil C does occur and therefore the greatest efficiency in soil C sequestration will be in soils further from C saturation.

TI  - Influence of drip and furrow irrigation systems on nitrogen oxide emissions from a horticultural crop
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Irrigation management has an important influence on emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitric oxide (NO) from irrigated agricultural soils. In order to develop strategies to reduce the emission of these gases, a field experiment was carried out to compare the influence of different irrigation systems: furrow (FI) and drip-irrigation (DI), on N 2 O and NO emissions from a soil during the melon crop season. Two fertilizer treatments were evaluated for each irrigation regime: ammonium sulphate (AS) as a mineral N fertilizer, at a rate of 175 kg N ha −1 ; and a control without any N fertilizer (Control). On plots where the AS treatment was applied, drip irrigation reduced total N 2 O and NO emissions (by 70% and 33% respectively) with respect to values for furrow irrigation. This was probably due to the lower amount of water applied and the different soil wetting pattern associated with DI. Dry areas of the drip-irrigated plots emitted a similar amount of N 2 O to the wet areas (0.45 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 ) in the Control and greater quantities in the AS treatment (0.92 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 for dry and 0.70 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 for wet areas). We suggest that the N oxide pulses observed throughout the irrigation period on DI plots could have been the result of frequent increases in the soil wetting volume after the addition of water. Denitrification losses (from depths of 0–10 cm) were estimated at 11.44 kg N 2 O- N ha −1 for the AS treatment under FI and at 4.96 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 for DI. Under DI, nitrification was an important source of N 2 O, whereas denitrification was the most important source under FI. The addition of NH 4 + and the use of DI enhanced the N 2 O/N 2 ratio of gases produced through denitrification. The quantity of dissolved organic C (DOC) in the soil generally decreased with addition of NH 4 + . This work showed that, in comparison with furrow irrigation, drip irrigation is a method that can be used to save water and mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N 2 O.

TI  - Tillage, crop residue and N fertilizer effects on crop yield, nutrient uptake, soil quality and nitrous oxide gas emissions in a second 4-yr rotation cycle
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract An 8-yr (1998–2005) field experiment was conducted on a Gray Luvisol (Boralf) soil near Star City, Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine the effects of tillage (no-tillage – NT and conventional tillage – CT), straw management (straw retained – R and straw not retained – NR) and N fertilizer (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha −1 , except no N to pea ( Pisum sativum L.) phase of the rotation) on seed and straw yield, mass of N and C in crop, organic C and N, inorganic N and aggregation in soil, and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions for a second 4-yr rotation cycle (2002–2005). The plots were seeded to barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) in 2002, pea in 2003, wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004 and canola ( Brassica napus L.) in 2005. Seed, straw and chaff yield, root mass, and mass of N and C in crop increased with increasing N rate for barley in 2002, wheat in 2004 and canola in 2005. No-till produced greater seed (by 51%), straw (23%) and chaff (13%) yield of barley than CT in 2002, but seed yield for wheat in 2004, and seed and straw yield for canola in 2005 were greater under CT than NT. Straw retention increased seed (by 62%), straw (by 43%) and chaff (by 12%) yield, and root mass (by 11%) compared to straw removal for barley in 2002, wheat in 2004, and seed and straw yield for pea in 2003. No-till resulted in greater mass of N in seed, and mass of C in seed, straw, chaff and root than CT for barley in 2002, but mass of N and C were greater under CT than NT for wheat in 2004 and for canola in 2005 in many cases. Straw retention had greater mass of N and C in seed, straw, chaff and root in most cases compared to straw removal for barley in 2002, pea in 2003 and wheat in 2004. Soil moisture content in spring was higher under NT than CT and with R than NR in the 0–15 cm depth, with the highest moisture content in the NT + R treatment in many cases. After eight crop seasons, tillage and straw management had no effect on total organic C (TOC) and N (TON) in the 0–15 cm soil, but light fraction organic C (LFOC) and N (LFON), respectively, were greater by 1.275 Mg C ha −1 and 0.031 Mg N ha −1 with R than NR, and also greater by 0.563 Mg C ha −1 and 0.044 Mg N ha −1 under NT than CT. There was no effect of tillage, straw and N fertilization on the NH 4 -N in soil in most cases, but R treatment had higher NO 3 -N concentration in the 0–15 cm soil than NR. The NO 3 -N concentration in the 0–15, 15–30 and 30–60 cm soil layers increased (though small) with increasing N rate. The R treatment had 6.7% lower proportion of fine ( 38.0 mm) dry aggregates, and 4.5 mm larger mean weight diameter (MWD) compared to NR treatment. This suggests a lower potential for soil erosion when crop residues are retained. There was no beneficial effect of elimination of tillage on soil aggregation. The amount of N lost as N 2 O was higher from N-fertilized (580 g N ha −1 ) than from zero-N (155 g N ha −1 ) plots, and also higher in CT (398 g N ha −1 ) than NT (340 g N ha −1 ) in some cases. In conclusion, retaining crop residues along with no-tillage improved some soil properties and may also be better for the environment and the sustainability of high crop production. Nitrogen fertilization improved crop production and some soil quality attributes, but also increased the potential for NO 3 -N leaching and N 2 O-N emissions, especially when applied in excess of crop requirements.

TI  - The influence of cover crops and tillage on water and sediment yield, and on nutrient, and organic matter losses in an olive orchard on a sandy loam soil
PY  - 2009
AB  - Is the cover crop practice suitable for soil and water conservation in olive tree cropping? Rainfall, runoff, sediments, nutrient and organic carbon losses from 8 x 60 m plots were measured during four hydrological years (2002-2007) in a field trial, in which two different soil management systems were used to confirm this hypothesis: a cover crop (CC), and conventional tillage (CT). The plots were located in a private olive tree farm on a sandy-loam soil, near Seville, southern Spain. The cover crop, as compared to conventional tillage, efficiently reduced runoff and sediment yield down to tolerable levels, 5.68% of the rainfall being converted to runoff, and the soil loss reaching 0.04 kg m ―2 year ―1 , as the average of four years. Additionally, in the cover crop treatment, the values of the nutrient export either dissolved in the runoff water or adsorbed in the sediment, were lower than the analogous values of the conventional tillage treatment: 0.631 and 0.065 kg m- 2 year ―1 of organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively, 0.175 and 0.0333 kg m ―2 year ―1 of soluble K and P, respectively, and 0.010 and 0.002 kg m ―2 year ―1 of available K and P, respectively. The adoption of a cover crop as a soil management practice can be a feasible way to reach sustainability in many olive-cropped soils of southern Spain, although this method is not always easy to implement due to technical problems such as seed selection, its maintenance, and the choice of the correct killing date to avoid water competition. These difficulties could explain the slow rate of its adoption by many farmers. Further exploration of these aspects is required, as well as a specific agricultural extension campaign.

TI  - Quantitative Trait Loci Analysis of Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Arabidopsis
PY  - 2003
AB  - Improving plant nitrogen (N) use efficiency or controlling soil N requires a better knowledge of the regulation of plant N metabolism. This could be achieved using Arabidopsis as a model genetic system, taking advantage of the natural variation available among ecotypes. Here, we describe an extensive study of N metabolism variation in the Bay-0 × Shahdara recombinant inbred line population, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We mapped QTL for traits such as shoot growth, total N, nitrate, and free-amino acid contents, measured in two contrasting N environments (contrasting nitrate availability in the soil), in controlled conditions. Genetic variation and transgression were observed for all traits, and most of the genetic variation was identified through QTL and QTL × QTL epistatic interactions. The 48 significant QTL represent at least 18 loci that are polymorphic between parents; some may correspond to known genes from the N metabolic pathway, but others represent new genes controlling or interacting with N physiology. The correlations between traits are dissected through QTL colocalizations: The identification of the individual factors contributing to the regulation of different traits sheds new light on the relations among these characters. We also point out that the regulation of our traits is mostly specific to the N environment (N availability). Finally, we describe four interesting loci at which positional cloning is feasible.

TI  - Varietal differences in perennial ryegrass for nitrogen use efficiency in leaf growth following defoliation: performance in flowing solution culture and its relationship to yield under simulated grazing in the field
PY  - 1997
AB  - Varietal differences in rates of NO3 uptake and remobilization of nitrogen (N) during a cycle of severe defoliation and regrowth were assessed in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) varieties Ba11778, Aberelan, Talbot and Gator. Plants were grown in flowing solution culture for 34 days, prior to a 30 d treatment period, including 21 d of regrowth. Net uptake of NO3 was measured continuously from solutions maintained automatically at 10 mmol m-3NO3.15 N-labelled NO3
 3 was supplied to the plants in situ for either 21 h immediately prior to defoliation, or for 7-11 days afterwards, to measure remobilization of N from roots and stubble into the regrowing leaves. The four varieties differed only slightly in total dry matter production over 30 d, but varied substantially in post-defoliation specific growth rate by the leaf fraction. Gator was the lowest ( 0.11 g g-1 d-1), Ba11778 the highest ( 0.15 g g-1 d-1) and Aberelan and Talbot intermediate in leaf regrowth rate. Varieties did not vary significantly in shoot: root dry weight ratio, but the rate of NO3 uptake per unit of leaf fresh weight during regrowth was 27% lower in Ba11778 than in Gator. Leaves of Ba11778 and Aberelan had a lower organic N concentration in the dry matter at the end of the regrowth period than Talbot, which, in turn, had a lower concentration than Gator. Varieties differed in amount of leaf dry matter produced per unit of N absorbed by the plants after defoliation, the values (g g-1 N) being Ba11778 (22.6 ), Aberelan (20.7), Talbot (18.3) and Gator (16.7). More N was remobilized from the roots than from the stubble after defoliation. There were no significant differences among varieties in the amount and rate of N remobilization following defoliation. In earlier field experiments employing frequent cutting to simulate grazing, Ba11778 and Aberelan yielded at least 10% more dry matter annually than Talbot which, in turn, outyielded the amenity variety Gator by a similar amount. Thus the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that the efficiency of N use in leaf growth is an important factor determining genetic variation in productivity under frequent defoliation in the field when the herbage produced consists primarily of leaf.

TI  - Tillage Effects on Soil Organic Carbon Fractions in Mediterranean Dryland Agroecosystems
PY  - 2008
AB  - Under semiarid conditions, soil quality and productivity can be improved by enhancing soil organic matter content by means of alternative management practices. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of no-till (NT) and cropping intensification as alternative soil practices to increase soil organic C (SOC). At the same time, we studied the influence of these management practices on two SOC fractions (particulate organic matter C, POM-C, and the mineral-associated C, Min-C), in semiarid agroecosystems of the Ebro River valley. Soil samples were collected from five soil layers (0-5-, 5-10-, 10-20-, 20-30-, 30-40-cm depth) during July 2005 at three long-term tillage experiments located at different sites in the Ebro River valley (northeast Spain). Soil bulk density, SOC concentration and content, SOC stratification ratio, POM-C, and Min-C were measured. Higher soil bulk density was observed under NT than under reduced tillage (RT), subsoil tillage (ST), or conventional tillage (CT). At the soil surface (0-5-cm depth), the highest total SOC concentration, POM-C, and Min-C were measured under NT, followed by RT, ST, and CT, respectively. In the whole soil profile (0-40 cm), similarly, slightly greater SOC content was measured under NT than under CT with the exception of the Selvanera site, where deep subsoil tillage combined with moldboard plowing accumulated more SOC than NT. In semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems where CT consists in moldboard plowing, NT is a viable management practice to increase SOC.

TI  - Fluxes of nitrous oxide from soil under different crop rotations and tillage systems in the South of Brazil
PY  - 2008
AB  - The zero tillage (ZT) system is used in a large area (>24 Mha) of crop production in Brazil. This management system can contribute to soil C sequestration, but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under ZT compared to conventional tillage (CT), which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission of N2O from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18-year-old experiment conducted on a Rhodic Ferralsol in the South of Brazil. Fluxes of N2O were measured over two years using static-closed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations. Soil water filled pore space (%WFPS) and soil mineral N were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature. Estimates of N2O emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the IPCC direct emission factor (EF1 = 1%) to the amounts of N added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues. Fluxes of N2O were relatively low, apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements. No relationship between N2O fluxes and %WFPS or mineral N were observed. Nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation. For the crop rotation receiving high rates of N fertiliser in the second year, field-measured N2O emissions were significantly underestimated by the IPCC emission factor 1 (EF1). For the other treatments measured N2O emissions fell within the EF1 uncertainty range, but always considerably lower than the EF1 estimate, which suggests IPCC EF1 overestimates true N2O emissions for the Ferralsol under evaluation.

TI  - Fate of fertilizer nitrogen applied to wheat under simulated Mediterranean environmental conditions.
PY  - 1990
AB  - Triticum aestivumThe fate of fertilizer nitrogen applied to dryland wheat was studied in the greenhouse under simulated Mediterranian-type climatic conditions. Wheat, L., was grown in 76-cm-deep pots, each containing 50–70 kg of soil, and subjected to different watering regimes. Two calcareous clay soils were used in the experiments, Uvalde clay (Aridic Calciustoll) and Vernon clay (Typic Ustochrept). Fertilizer nitrogen balance studies were conducted using various15N-labeled nitrogen sources, including ammonium nitrate, urea, and urea amended with urea phosphate, phenyl phosphorodiamidate (a urease inhibitor), and dicyandiamide (a nitrification inhibitor). Wheat yields were most significantly affected by available water. With additional water during the growing period, the recovery of fertilizer nitrogen by wheat increased and the fraction of fertilizer nitrogen remaining in the soil decreased. In the driest regimes, from 40 to 65% of the fertilizer nitrogen remained in the soils. In most experiments the gaseous loss of fertilizer nitrogen, as estimated from unaccounted for15N, was not significantly affected by water regime. The15N not accounted for in the plant and the soil at harvest ranged from 12 to 25% for ammonium nitrate and from 12 to 38% for regular urea. Direct measurement of labeled ammonia loss from soil indicated that ammonia volatilization probably was the main N loss mechanism. Low unaccounted-for15N from nitrate-labeled ammonium nitrate, 4 to 10%, indicated that N losses due to denitrification, gaseous loss from plants, or shedding of anthers and pollen were small or negligible. Amendment of urea with urea phosphate to form a 36% N and 7.3% P product was ineffective in reducing N loss. Dicyandiamide did not reduce N loss from urea presumably because N was not leached from the sealed pots and denitrification was insignificant. Amendment of urea with 2% phenyl phosphorodiamidate reduced N loss significantly. However, band placement of urea at as 2-cm soil depth was more effective in reducing N loss than was amendment of broadcast urea with phenyl phosphorodiamidate.

TI  - Quantifying and isolating stable soil organic carbon using long-term bare fallow experiments
PY  - 2010
AB  - The stability of soil organic matter (SOM) is a major source of uncertainty in predicting atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century. Isolating the stable soil carbon (C) from other, more labile, C fractions in soil is of prime importance for calibrating soil C simulation models, and gaining insights into the mechanisms that lead to soil C stability. Long-term experiments with continuous bare fallow (vegetation-free) treatments in which the decay of soil C is monitored for decades after all inputs of C have stopped, provide a unique opportunity to assess the quantity of stable soil C.We analyzed data from six bare fallow experiments of long-duration (>30 yrs), covering a range of soil types and climate conditions, and sited at Askov (Denmark), Grignon and Versailles (France), Kursk (Russia), Rothamsted (UK), and Ultuna (Sweden). A conceptual three pool model dividing soil C into a labile pool (turnover time of a several years), an intermediate pool (turnover time of a several decades) and a stable pool (turnover time of a several centuries or more) fits well with the long term C decline observed in the bare fallow soils. The estimate of stable C ranged from 2.7 g Ckg−1 at Rothamsted to 6.8 g C kg−1 at Grignon. The uncertainty associated with estimates of the stable pool was large due to the short duration of the fallow treatments relative to the turnover time of stable soil C. At Versailles, where there is least uncertainty associated with the determination of a stable pool, the soil contains predominantly stable C after 80 years of continuous bare fallow. Such a site represents a unique research platform for characterization of the nature of stable SOM and its vulnerability to global change.

TI  - Tillage and crop rotation effects on barley yield and soil nutrients on a Calciortidic Haploxeralf
PY  - 2006
AB  - Reduced tillage with appropriate crop rotation could increase the viability of dry land agriculture in semiarid zones. The effects of tillage and crop rotation on soil physico-chemical properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) and N have been studied widely in long and short-term experiments. However, their effects on nutrient levels and fertility losses have not been extensively studied in Mediterranean soils. We determined SOC, N, P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn distribution in the soil profile and in plant uptake, on a Calciortidic Haploxeralf in Spain. Three tillage systems [CT, conventional tillage (mouldboard plow); MT, minimum tillage and NT, no tillage] and three crop rotations [BB, continuous barley (Hordeum vulgarev. Tipper), FB, fallow-barley and VB, vetch (Vicia sativa v. Muza)-barley] were compared. SOC and N were higher for CT than for MT and NT in the first year, but higher for NT and MT than CT in the next years. In the 0–15 cm depth, SOC and N in NT also became higher than in MT for the fourth crop season. In the 15–30 depths, NT and MT had also higher SOC than CT since the second year. However, NT had only higher N than MT after three crop seasons. The increase in SOC was 75% for NT and MT while CT had a decrease of 17% in the 0–15 cm layer. The increase in N was 154% for NT, 108% for MT and 30% for CT in the upper 15 cm. NT had higher P, K and Cu than MT and higher P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn than CT in the upper layers due to the higher SOC level and to the fact that these systems maintain surfaceapplied K and P fertilizer. On the other hand, neither SOC nor N were affected by crop rotation. Tillage and rotation interactions were not significant for SOC, N and, in general, nutrient levels in the different soil depths. In general, the main factor that affected SOC, N and nutrients was tillage, which had reduced influence with depth. Highest yield was for CT-FB and CT-VB, but not different from NT-FB and NT-VB, meanwhile highest nutrient levels were obtained for interactions that included NT. These results suggest that NT, and to a lesser extend MT, preserved SOC and nutrient levels in the upper layers and, with NT-VB and NT-FB interaction, could also obtain high yields and keep soil fertility in the upper depths during the first 4 years. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Variations in soil microbial biomass and N availability due to residue and tillage management in a dryland rice agroecosystem.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Seasonal changes in the levels of soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), N-mineralization rate and available-N concentration were studied in rice-barley supporting tropical dryland (rainfed) agroecosystem under six combinations of tillage (conventional, minimum and zero tillage) and crop residue manipulation (retained or removed) conditions. Highest levels of soil MBC and MBN (368-503 and 38.2-59.7 m gg ˇ1 , respectively) were obtained in minimum tillage residue retained (MTaR) treatment and lowest levels (214-264 and 20.3-27.1 m gg ˇ1 , respectively) in conventional tillage residue removed (CTR, control) treatment. Along with residue retention tillage reduction from conventional to zero increased the levels of MBC and MBN (36-82 and 29-104% over control, respectively). The proportion of MBC and MBN in soil organic C and total N contents increased significantly in all treatments compared to control. This increase (28% in case of C and 33% N) was maximum in MTaR and minimum (10% for C and N both) in minimum tillage residue removed (MTR) treatment. In all treatments concentrations of N in microbial biomass were greater at seedling stage, thereafter these concentrations decreased drastically (21-38%) at grain-forming stage of both crops. In residue removed treatments, N-mineralization rates were maximum during the seedling stage of crops and then decreased through the crop maturity. In residue retained treatments, however, N-mineralization rates were lower than in residue removed treatments at seedling stage of both crops. At grain-forming stage in all instances the N-mineralization rates in residue retained treatments considerably exceeded the rates in corresponding residue removed treatments. Tillage reduction and residue retention both increased the proportion of organic C and total N present in soil organic matter as microbial biomass. Microbial immobilization of available-N during the early phase of crops and its pulsed release later during the period of greater N demand of crops enhanced the degree of synchronization between crop demand and N supply. The maximum enhancement effects were recorded in the minimum tillage along with residue retained treatment. In the dryland agroecosystem studied, two management practices in combination proved more advantageous than either practice alone in maintaining soil fertility levels. For soil fertility amelioration in dryland agroecosystems with least dependence upon chemical fertilizer input, post-harvest retention of about 20 cm shoot biomass (accounting for 25-40% aboveground biomass) of previous crop and its incorporation in soil through minimum tillage in the succeeding crop is suggested, especially in the case of cereal. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Impact of Tillage and Residue Burning on Carbon Dioxide Flux in a Wheat-Soybean Production System
PY  - 2006
AB  - Burning of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residue followed by plowing is a common management practice in wheat-soybean [Glycine Max (L.) Merrill] production systems in the mid-southern USA. However, this residue management practice is not environmentally friendly and may not be sustainable. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the effects of N fertilization of wheat, residue burning, and tillage on soil surface carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flux in a wheat-soybean double-crop production system, and (ii) evaluate the role of soil temperature and soil moisture in controlling CO 2 flux in a relatively warm, subhumid environment. Soil surface CO 2 flux was measured nine times between June 2002 and October 2003 during the soybean growing season under all combinations of conventional- (CT) and no-tillage (NT) at high and low N fertilization levels with and without residue burning at two locations in the Mississippi River delta region of eastern Arkansas. Soil surface CO 2 flux was 37.6% higher (P < 0.01) from CT than from NT and 6.1% higher (P < 0.05) from the low than the high N rate treatment at one location, but not at the other. Burning did not affect soil surface CO 2 flux except for a significant burning X N rate (P = 0.016) and burning X time interaction (P = 0.032) at one location, but not at the other. Both soil temperature and moisture parameters were significantly negatively correlated with temperature-normalized soil surface CO 2 flux, but soil temperature, particularly at the 10-cm depth, explained more of the variation than did soil moisture parameters. The results of this study indicate that tillage and N fertilization of prior wheat, but not residue burning, affect the loss of C as CO 2 from the soil and that there are additional soil and/or environmental factors, other than near-surface soil moisture and temperature fluctuations, perhaps microbial biomass, that contribute to controlling soil surface CO 2 flux in wheat-soybean production systems in the subhumid region of southern USA.

TI  - Carbon sequestration determined using farm scale carbon balance and eddy covariance
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Studies using eddy covariance have shown grasslands to be both sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). However, such studies do not take into account the exports of carbon (C), such as in meat and milk and imports of C, such as off-farm derived C in cattle feed supplement. By coupling eddy covariance results with farm management data we quantified the farm scale C balance during 2004 for two dairy farms in South West Ireland. The system boundary for inputs and outputs of C is the farm perimeter. Carbon sequestration is determined as the difference between all C inputs and C outputs. Carbon inputs are similar in both farms with net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (2.9 ± 0.5 t C ha −1  year −1 ) accounting for 88 and 81% of C inputs in Farms A and B, respectively. Carbon in concentrate feed accounts for 12 and 19% of C inputs in Farms A and B, respectively. Respiration by cattle during the winter housing period, and respiration by cows during milking throughout the grazing season, are the largest C outputs and account for approximately half of C outputs on both farms. The other major sources of C output are milk, CH 4 produced by enteric fermentation and emitted during slurry spreading and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streamflow. Carbon in meat and CH 4 emissions from dung (both in the farmyard and fields) and animal slurry in farmyard storage are minor sources of C output. The annual total C inputs are 3.30 and 3.58 t C ha −1 and the total C outputs are 1.25 and 1.43 t C ha −1 in Farms A and B, respectively. The net difference is 2.05 and 2.15 t C ha −1 in Farms A and B, respectively. This suggests that both farms were net C sinks for 2004. Further work on below ground process and soil C turnover is required to determine if this C sink estimate is reflected in changes in soil C stocks. Furthermore, we estimate the global warming potential (GWP) of this grassland to be a sink for ∼1 t CO 2  equiv. ha −1  year −1 .

TI  - Identification of traits to improve the nitrogen-use efficiency of wheat genotypes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Nitrogen (N) fertilizer represents a significant cost for the grower and may also have environmental impacts through nitrate leaching and N2O (a greenhouse gas) emissions associated with denitrification. The objectives of this study were to analyze the genetic variability in N-use efficiency (grain dry matter (DM) yield per unit N available from soil and fertilizer; NUE) in winter wheat and identify traits for improved NUE for application in breeding. Fourteen UK and French cultivars and two French advanced breeding lines were tested in a 2 year/four site network comprising different locations in France and in the UK. Detailed growth analysis was conducted at anthesis and harvest in experiments including DM and N partitioning. Senescence of either the flag leaf or the whole leaf canopy was assessed from a visual score every 3–4 days from anthesis to complete canopy senescence. The senescence score was fitted against thermal time using a five parameters monomolecular-logistic equation allowing the estimation of the timing of the onset and the rate of post-anthesis senescence. In each experiment, grain yield was reduced under low N (LN), with an average reduction of 2.2 t ha−1 (29%). Significant N × genotype level interaction was observed for NUE. Crop N uptake at harvest on average was reduced from 227 kg N ha−1 under high N (HN) to 109 kg N ha−1 under LN conditions while N-utilization efficiency (grain DM yield per unit crop N uptake at harvest; NUtE) increased from 34.0 to 52.1 kg DM kg−1 N. Overall genetic variability in NUE under LN related mainly to differences in NUtE rather than N-uptake efficiency (crop N uptake at harvest per unit N available from soil and fertilizer; NUpE). However, at one site there was also a positive correlation between NUpE and NUE at LN in both years. Moreover, across the 2 year/four site network, the N × genotype effect for NUpE partly explained the N × genotype effect for grain yield and NUE. Averaging across the 16 genotypes, the timing of onset of senescence explained 86% of the variation in NUtE amongst site-season-N treatment combinations. The linear regression of onset of senescence on NutE amongst genoytpes was not significant under HN, but at three of the four sites was significant under LN explaining 32–70% of the phenotypic variation amongst genotypes in NutE. Onset of senescence amongst genotypes was negatively correlated with the efficiency with which above-ground N at anthesis was remobilized to the grain under LN. It is concluded that delaying the onset of post-anthesis senescence may be an important trait for increasing grain yield of wheat grown under low N supply.

TI  - Combination of drip irrigation and organic fertilizer for mitigating emissions of nitrogen oxides in semiarid climate
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Fertilizer and irrigation management are two of the most important factors which directly influence nitrification and denitrification processes from agricultural soils and, therefore, emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). To date, the effect of combining organic fertilizer (applied before planting) with a drip irrigation system (DI) on the emissions of these nitrogen (N) oxides has not been evaluated. The different distribution and amount of water applied with this irrigation system should produce less favourable conditions for denitrification than other irrigation systems, such as furrow irrigation (FI), and this could be used to mitigate emissions of N2O, especially following organic fertilizer application. In order to test this hypothesis, a field experiment was carried out to compare the influence of FI and DI on N2O and NO emissions using digested pig slurry (DPS) as organic fertilizer during a melon crop (Cucumis melo L. cv. Sancho) season. Plots without any N fertilizer were used as a control (control). The irrigation system influenced the water distribution pattern, producing significantly higher ammonium-N (NH4+-N) and nitrate-N (NO3−-N) concentrations in the soil under DI than under FI. Moreover, the differences observed in water filled pore space (WFPS) and mineral N also favoured a different pattern of emissions of N oxides. Only one large pulse of N2O (106.9 mg N m−2 d−1) and NO (0.81 mg N m−2 d−1) were observed for FI after the first irrigation event while several pulses were observed for DI during the entire experimental period. As a consequence, nitrous oxide emissions were 75% and 28% lower from control and DPS, respectively under DI than under FI. In contrast, NO emissions were higher for DI on some sampling dates in both treatments, but without significant differences in the cumulative NO emissions between both irrigation systems. In conclusion, this work shows that combining drip irrigation with organic fertilizer for horticultural crops in semiarid climates could be a good management strategy for three reasons: it saves water; it re-uses organic residues and it mitigates N2O emissions.

TI  - Tillage, Nitrogen, and Cropping System Effects on Soil Carbon Sequestration
PY  - 2002
AB  - Soil C sequestration can improve soil quality and reduce agriculture's contribution to CO 2 emissions. The long-term (12 yr) effects of tillage system and N fertilization on crop residue production and soil organic C (SOC) sequestration in two dryland cropping systems in North Dakota on a loam soil were evaluated. An annual cropping (AC) rotation [spring wheat (SW) (Triticum aestivum L.)-winter wheat (WW)-sunflower (SF) (Helianthus annuus L.)] and a spring wheat-fallow (SW-F) rotation were studied. Tillage systems included conventional-till (CT), minimum-till (MT), and no-till (NT). Nitrogen rates were 34, 67, and 101 kg N ha -1 for the AC system and 0, 22, and 45 kg N ha -1 for the SW-F system. Total crop residue returned to the soil was greater with AC than with SW-F. As tillage intensity decreased, SOC sequestration increased (NT > MT > CT) in the AC system but not in the SW-F system. Fertilizer N increased crop residue quantity returned to the soil, but generally did not increase SOC sequestration in either cropping system. Soil bulk density decreased with increasing tillage intensity in both systems. The results suggest that continued use of a crop-fallow farming system, even with NT, may result in loss of SOC. With NT, an estimated 233 kg C ha -1 was sequestered each year in AC system, compared with 25 kg C ha -1 with MT and a loss of 141 kg C ha -1 with CT. Conversion from crop-fallow to more intensive cropping systems utilizing NT will be needed to have a positive impact on reducing CO 2 loss from croplands in the northern Great Plains.

TI  - Microbial responses to simulated tillage in cultivated and uncultivated soils
PY  - 2000
AB  - Tillage is known to have long-term eAects on organic matter and labile pools of nutrients in soil, but the short-term changes in microbial dynamics and activity after tillage are less well understood. We investigated the immediate eAects of simulated tillage on microbial community structure as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, microbial activity, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. Intact cores were obtained from Chualar sandy loam soils under grassland and vegetable production. The top 15 cm of soil was sieved to simulate tillage, then the cores were incubated in the greenhouse. Sampling took place 1 day before the tillage simulation and throughout the next 2 weeks. In the grassland soil, multivariate analysis showed changes in PLFA profiles within hours, indicating rapid changes in microbial community structure. Specific PLFA markers indicated a reduction in microeukaryotic biomass as well as an increase in a microbial stress marker after sieving. Respiration (as determined by soil incubation in sealed containers) decreased immediately after sieving and continued to decline through the next 14 days. Sieving was followed by a continuous accumulation of nitrate. In the vegetable soil, the changes in PLFA profiles were slow and gradual. The PLFA stress indicator rose only slightly. Microbial activity and biomass were low, and only small changes occurred in most variables. A decline in respiration and an increase in nitrate occurred several days after sieving. In both soils, decreased soil moisture may have contributed to changes in soil responses after sieving. Short-term responses to tillage may be less pronounced in soils with a long history of cultivation because of a relatively resilient microbial community and/or because lower initial microbial biomass and nutrient pools preclude a strong response to disturbance. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Winter carbon dioxide fluxes in humid-temperate pastures
PY  - 2007
AB  - Because of their vast size, grazing lands have the potential to sequester significant quantities of carbon, slowing the increase in atmospheric CO2 and reducing the risk of global warming. Although CO2 uptake during the growing season can be substantial, losses during winter months reduce annual sequestration, potentially turning grazing lands into net carbon sources. The goal of this research was to quantify the magnitude of winter fluxes for humid-temperate pastures in the northeastern USA. The study was conducted from 2003 to 2005 on two pastures in the ridge and valley region of central Pennsylvania, one dominated by a mix of cool-season grasses and the other transitioning from an alfalfa to mixed-grass pasture. Pasture-scale CO2 fluxes were quantified using eddy covariance techniques. The alfalfa pasture was less of a CO2 source to the atmosphere during winter months (1 December to 31 March) than the grass pasture, averaging 2.68 g CO2 m−2 day−1 compared with 3.09 g CO2 m−2 day−1 for the grass pasture. Cumulative efflux for the winter months averaged 326 g CO2 m−2 (88 g C m−2) for the alfalfa and 375 g CO2 m−2 (101 g C m−2) for the grass pasture. In the absence of snow cover, eddy covariance measurements estimated that photosynthetic CO2 uptake occurred at temperatures below 0 °C. Canopy and leaf chamber measurements in the field and in controlled environments suggested minimum temperatures for photosynthetic CO2 uptake of about −4 °C. Even when daytime uptake occurred, nighttime efflux from the system was greater so that the pastures remained CO2 sources throughout the winter.

TI  - Soil physical properties and wheat root growth as affected by no-tillage and conventional tillage systems in a Mediterranean environment of Chile
PY  - 2008
AB  - No-tillage systems affect soil properties depending on the soil, climate, and the time since its implementation. In heavy no-tilled soils a surface compacted layer is commonly found. Such layer can affect root growth and soil water infiltration. In several cases, surface organic carbon can buffer these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 4- and 7-year-old conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) treatments on soil physical properties, root growth, and wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) yield in an Entic Haploxeroll of Central Chile. In both tillage treatments we study soil water retention, bulk density (rb), soil particle density (rs), soil water infiltration, mean-weight diameter of soil aggregates (MWD), penetration resistance, grain yield, and root length density (Lv) up to a depth of 15 cm. The MWD and the penetration resistance were higher under NTas compared to CT. For the top 5 cm of soil, Lv was greater under NTas compared to CT. Differences of Lv between NTand CTwere 2.09, 7.60, and 4.31 cm root cm � 3 soil during the two leaves, flowering and grain filling phenological stages, respectively. Generally, the effect of NTon these properties was more evident near the soil surface. In contrast, fast drainage macropores, rs, and soil water infiltration rates were higher under CT than under NT. Tillage treatments did not significantly affect rb and yield. A longer time under no-tillage enhanced aggregate stability, however, other soil physical properties were negatively affected. # 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A short-term investigation of trace gas emissions following tillage and no-tillage of agroforestry residues in western Kenya
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract Improved-fallow agroforestry systems are increasingly being adopted in the humid tropics for soil fertility management. However, there is little information on trace gas emissions after residue application in these systems, or on the effect of tillage practice on emissions from tropical agricultural systems. Here, we report a short-term experiment in which the effects of tillage practice (no-tillage versus tillage to 15 cm depth) and residue quality on emissions of N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 were determined in an improved-fallow agroforestry system in western Kenya. Emissions were increased following tillage of Tephrosia candida (2.1 g N 2 O-N ha −1  kg N applied −1 ; 759 kg CO 2 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 ; 30 g CH 4 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 ) and Crotalaria paulina residues (2.8 g N 2 O-N ha −1  kg N applied −1 ; 967 kg CO 2 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 ; 146 g CH 4 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 ) and were higher than from tillage of natural-fallow residues (1.0 g N 2 O-N ha −1  kg N applied −1 ; 432 kg CO 2 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 ; 14.7 g CH 4 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 ) or from continuous maize cropping systems. Emissions from these fallow treatments were positively correlated with residue N content ( r  = 0.62–0.97; P r  = −0.56, N 2 O; r  = −0.92, CH 4 ; P Tephrosia residues lowered the total N 2 O and CO 2 emitted over 99 days by 0.33 g N 2 O-N ha −1  kg N applied −1 and 124 kg CO 2 -C ha −1  t C applied −1 , respectively; estimated to provide a reduction in global warming potential of 41 g CO 2 equivalents. However, emissions were increased from this treatment over the first 2 weeks. The responses to tillage practice and residue quality reported here need to be verified in longer term experiments before they can be used to suggest mitigation strategies appropriate for all three greenhouse gases.

TI  - An assessment of greenhouse gas emissions: implications for the Australian cotton industry
PY  - 2010
AB  - The majority of cotton produced in Australia is exported. The Australian cotton industry must maintain product quality in order to remain globally competitive. In addition, carbon-conscious consumers need reassurance that the system used to grow the product is environmentally sustainable. The aim of the present study was to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to various farm inputs in three common types of cotton farming systems on the Darling Downs region, southern Queensland. Analysis revealed that GHG emissions for dryland solid-plant and dryland double-skip cotton farming systems are similar, but emissions are much higher for irrigated solid-plant cotton farming (1367, 1274 and 4841 kg CO2e/ha, respectively). However, if comparisons of GHG emissions are based on yield (per tonne), the positions of dryland double-skip farming and dryland solid-plant farming are reversed, but the position of irrigated cotton farming still remains as the highest GHG emitter. If the cotton industry comes under the Australian Government Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) without any subsidies and preconditions, and with a carbon price of A$25/t CO2e, the costs borne by each system would be A$66.8/t for the irrigated cotton industry, A$39.7/t for the dryland solid-plant cotton industry and A$43.6/t for the dryland double-skip cotton industry. This suggests that irrigated cotton would be more profitable in financial terms but with heavy environmental sustainability costs.

TI  - Soil carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from long-term tillage systems in continuous corn and corn–soybean rotations
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Although the Midwestern United States is one of the world's major agricultural production areas, few studies have assessed the effects of the region's predominant tillage and rotation practices on greenhouse gas emissions from the soil surface. Our objectives were to (a) assess short-term chisel (CP) and moldboard plow (MP) effects on soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes relative to no-till (NT) and, (b) determine how tillage and rotation interactions affect seasonal gas emissions in continuous corn and corn–soybean rotations on a poorly drained Chalmers silty clay loam (Typic Endoaquoll) in Indiana. The field experiment itself began in 1975. Short-term gas emissions were measured immediately before, and at increasing hourly intervals following primary tillage in the fall of 2004, and after secondary tillage in the spring of 2005, for up to 168 h. To quantify treatment effects on seasonal emissions, gas fluxes were measured at weekly or biweekly intervals for up to 14 sampling dates in the growing season for corn. Both CO 2 and CH 4 emissions were significantly affected by tillage but not by rotation in the short-term following tillage, and by rotation during the growing season. Soil temperature and moisture conditions in the surface 10 cm were significantly related to CO 2 emissions, although the proportion of variation explained by temperature and moisture was generally very low (never exceeded 27%) and varied with the tillage system being measured. In the short-term, CO 2 emissions were significantly higher for CP than MP and NT. Similarly, mean seasonal CO 2 emissions during the 2-year period were higher for CP (6.2 Mg CO 2 -C ha −1  year −1 ) than for MP (5.9 Mg CO 2 -C ha −1  year −1 ) and NT (5.7 Mg CO 2 -C ha −1  year −1 ). Both CP and MP resulted in low net CH 4 uptake (7.6 and 2.4 kg CH 4 -C ha −1  year −1 , respectively) while NT resulted in net emissions of 7.7 kg CH 4 -C ha −1  year −1 . Mean emissions of CO 2 were 16% higher from continuous corn than from rotation corn during the two growing seasons. After 3 decades of consistent tillage and crop rotation management for corn and soybean producing grain yields well above average in the Midwest, continuous NT production in the corn–soybean rotation was identified as the system with the least soil-derived C emissions to the atmosphere from among those evaluated prior to and during corn production.

TI  - Tillage and soil carbon sequestration—What do we really know?
PY  - 2006
AB  - It is widely believed that soil disturbance by tillage was a primary cause of the historical loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) in North America, and that substantial SOC sequestration can be accomplished by changing from conventional plowing to less intensive methods known as conservation tillage. This is based on experiments where changes in carbon storage have been estimated through soil sampling of tillage trials. However, sampling protocol may have biased the results. In essentially all cases where conservation tillage was found to sequester C, soils were only sampled to a depth of 30 cm or less, even though crop roots often extend much deeper. In the few studies where sampling extended deeper than 30 cm, conservation tillage has shown no consistent accrual of SOC, instead showing a difference in the distribution of SOC, with higher concentrations near the surface in conservation tillage and higher concentrations in deeper layers under conventional tillage. These contrasting results may be due to tillage-induced differences in thermal and physical conditions that affect root growth and distribution. Long-term, continuous gas exchange measurements have also been unable to detect C gain due to reduced tillage. Though there are other good reasons to use conservation tillage, evidence that it promotes C sequestration is not compelling.

TI  - The potential to mitigate global warming with no‐tillage management is only realized when practised in the long term
PY  - 2004
AB  - No-tillage (NT) management has been promoted as a practice capable of offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of its ability to sequester carbon in soils. However, true mitigation is only possible if the overall impact of NT adoption reduces the net global warming potential (GWP) determined by fluxes of the three major biogenic GHGs (i.e. CO2, N2O, and CH4). We compiled all available data of soil-derived GHG emission comparisons between conventional tilled (CT) and NT systems for humid and dry temperate climates. Newly converted NT systems increase GWP relative to CT practices, in both humid and dry climate regimes, and longer-term adoption (>10 years) only significantly reduces GWP in humid climates. Mean cumulative GWP over a 20-year period is also reduced under continuous NT in dry areas, but with a high degree of uncertainty. Emissions of N2O drive much of the trend in net GWP, suggesting improved nitrogen management is essential to realize the full benefit from carbon storage in the soil for purposes of global warming mitigation. Our results indicate a strong time dependency in the GHG mitigation potential of NT agriculture, demonstrating that GHG mitigation by adoption of NT is much more variable and complex than previously considered, and policy plans to reduce global warming through this land management practice need further scrutiny to ensure success.

TI  - Simulation of fluxes of greenhouse gases from European grasslands using the DNDC model
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural management of grasslands results in sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs, particularly CO2, N2O and CH4). Here, we used a process-based model (DNDC) to estimate the fluxes of the major GHGs from grasslands at 0.5° resolution across Europe, and combined these to produce a spatially explicit estimate of the total global warming potential (GWP, expressed in CO2 equivalents). The DNDC model [Li, C., Frolking, S., Crocker, G.J., Grace, P.R., Klir, J., Korchens, M., Poulton, P.R., 1997. Simulating trends in soil organic carbon in long-term experiments using the DNDC model. Geoderma 81, 45–60] simulates carbon and nitrogen cycling in agro-ecosystems at a sub-daily time step and consists of four interacting submodels: soil and climate (including water flow and leaching), plant growth, decomposition, and denitrification. Input data sets for grassland area, climate, nitrogen deposition, and soil properties were collated. The typical current grassland management regime was established for ten biogeographical regions on the basis of questionnaires sent to national experts, and used to derive model input data. A 20-year simulation was carried out using DNDC for each site. Simple estimates of methane emissions from grazing livestock were made according to the IPCC Tier 1 method. Most grassland areas are net sources for GHGs in terms of total global warming potential—the beneficial effect of sequestering carbon in soil is outweighed by the emissions of N2O from soil and (predominantly) CH4 emissions from livestock. The net effect of European grasslands on GWP (emission of 23 Tg C year−1) corresponds to a 2.5% increase on the EU-15 fossil fuel CO2 emissions (907 Tg C year−1)

TI  - Reduction of nitrogen surplus by material circulation between dairy farms and arable crop farms in the mixed production area, Japan
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract The problematic of nitrogen surplus in mixed production areas might be reduced by exchanging nitrogen-containing material between dairy farms and arable crop farms, e.g. livestock manure and wheat straw as bedding material, respectively, or by temporary land exchange. Estimating the influence of the nitrogen surplus by material circulation between 133 dairy farms and 115 arable crop farms in a certain district, the nitrogen surplus decreased by 0.05 Gg N/year because 0.18 Gg N/year of nitrogen surplus was decreased at dairy farms even though 0.135 Gg N/year of nitrogen surplus was increased at arable crop farms. These results indicated that the material circulation between livestock farms and arable crop farms is effective to decrease the nitrogen surplus in the region.

TI  - No tillage and crop rotation effects on soil aggregation and organic carbon in a Rhodic Ferralsol from southern Brazil
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract In Brazil, no tillage (NT) is a soil conservation practice now widely adopted by farmers, including smallholders. The effect of NT and conventional tillage (disc ploughing followed by two light disc harrowings, CT) was investigated on the aggregation properties of a clayey Rhodic Ferralsol from southern Brazil under different crop rotations. The same soil type under secondary forest was used as reference. Macro- and microaggregate classes were separated by wet sieving using a series of eight sieves (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.053 mm) at four sampling layers (0–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–30 cm). The soil in general had high structural stability. At 0–5 cm, meanweight diameter (MWD, 11.1 mm) and total organic C in macroaggregates (TOC, 39 g kg −1 soil) were highest for the forest soil. Soil under NT had a more similar distribution of aggregate size classes and TOC to the forest soil than CT. The most pronounced difference between tillage systems was observed in the surface soil layer (0–5 cm). In this layer, NT had higher aggregate stability (AS NT : 96%; AS CT : 89%), had higher values of aggregate size distribution (MWD NT : 7.9 mm, MWD CT : 4.3 mm), and had on average 28% greater TOC in all aggregate size classes than CT. Soil under NT had greater TOC in macroaggregates (NT: 22 g kg −1 ; CT: 13 g kg −1 ). Crop rotation did not have a significant effect on soil aggregate distribution and TOC. By increasing macroaggregation NT increased organic carbon accumulation in soil.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from a New Zealand cropped soil: tillage effects, spatial and seasonal variability
PY  - 2002
AB  - Agricultural practices are believed to be the major anthropogenic source of enhanced nitrous oxide (N 2O) gas emissions in New Zealand. Studies conducted in New Zealand generally suggest low N2O emission from pasture; however, there is little information for arable farming systems. This paper evaluates tillage and land use effects on N 2O emissions using a closed chamber technique at an Ohakea silt loam (Gleyic luvisol) where winter oats (Avena sativa L.)/fodder maize (Zea mays L.) was double-cropped for 5 years. The tillage types included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, and a permanent pasture (PP) was used as a control. Spatial variability in all treatments showed large inherent variations in N 2O fluxes (a mean CV = 119%), which reflected natural soil heterogeneity, and perhaps the measurement technique used rather than the real differences due to the tillage and cropping systems evaluated. On an annualised basis, N2O emissions measured from December 1998 to September 1999 from the PP (1.66 kg N2O-N/ha per year or 19 gN 2O-N/(m 2 h)) were significantly lower than the CT and NT fields averaging at 9.20 (or 105) and 12.0 (or 137) kg N2O-N/ha per year (or gN 2O-N/(m 2 h)), respectively. However, there were no differences in N2O emission rates between the CT and NT treatments. Seedbed preparation using a power harrow which followed within a few days of first ploughing the CT field reduced N 2O emissions by 65% within the first hour after power harrowing. However, N2O emission rates returned to the pre-power harrowing levels at the next sampling period, which was 1 month later. There was a strong relationship between log-transformed data of soil water content (SWC) and N2O emissions in all treatments with r = 0.73, 0.75 and 0.86 for the PP, CT and NT treatments, respectively. Seasonal variations in N2O emission from the PP were in the order of winter = autumn > summer. Although fluxes in the CT were higher in winter than in the autumn season, there were no differences between the summer and autumn data. The seasonal variations in N2O emission in the NT treatment were in the order of winter > autumn = summer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Sponsorship: EU Commission under contract EVK2-CT2001-00105 ?GREENGRASS? and contributed to COST Action 627- Carbon Storage in European Grasslands.The full greenhouse gas balance of nine contrasted grassland sites covering a major climatic gradient over Europe was measured during two complete years. The sites include a wide range of management regimes (rotational grazing, continuous grazing and mowing), the three main types of managed grasslands across Europe (sown, intensive permanent and semi-natural grassland) and contrasted nitrogen fertilizer supplies. At all sites, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was assessed using the eddy covariance technique. N2O emissions were monitored using various techniques (GC-cuvette systems, automated chambers and tunable diode laser) and CH4 emissions resulting from enteric fermentation of the grazing cattle were measured in situ at four sites using the SF6 tracer method. Averaged over the two measurement years, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) results show that the nine grassland plots displayed a net sink for atmospheric CO2 of ?240 ? 70 g C m?2 year?1 (mean ? confidence interval at p > 0.95). Because of organic C exports (from cut and removed herbage) being usually greater than C imports (from manure spreading), the average C storage (net biome productivity, NBP) in the grassland plots was estimated at ?104 ? 73 g C m?2 year?1, that is 43% of the atmospheric CO2 sink. On average of the 2 years, the grassland plots displayed annual N2O and CH4 (from enteric fermentation by grazing cattle) emissions, in CO2-C equivalents, of 14 ? 4.7 and 32 ? 6.8 g CO2-C equiv. m?2 year?1, respectively. Hence, when expressed in CO2-C equivalents, emissions of N2O and CH4 resulted in a 19% offset of the NEE sink activity. An attributed GHG balance has been calculated by subtracting from the NBP: (i) N2O and CH4 emissions occurring within the grassland plot and (ii) off-site emissions of CO2 and CH4 as a result of the digestion and enteric fermentation by cattle of the cut herbage. On average of the nine sites, the attributed GHG balance was not significantly different from zero (?85 ? 77 g CO2-C equiv. m?2 year?1). The net exchanges by the grassland ecosystems of CO2 and of GHG were highly correlated with the difference in carbon used by grazing versus cutting, indicating that cut grasslands have a greater on-site sink activity than grazed grasslands. However, the net biome productivity was significantly correlated to the total C used by grazing and cutting, indicating that, on average, net carbon storage declines with herbage utilisation for herbivores.Peer reviewe

TI  - Ammonia emissions from fields treated with green manure in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 1998
AB  - Abstract The ammonia flux from a green manured field was measured at a site in southern Italy. The green manure was provided by ploughing in about 66 and 78 t ha −1 of broad beans at the flowering stage during the spring in 1995 and 1996. The NH 3 flux was estimated by means of the micrometeorological simplified aerodynamic method with the ammonia concentration measured at two levels above soil surface. Ammonia concentration was measured over a 2–3 h sampling period by trapping air NH 3 in a H 2 SO 4 solution and analysing this sample in the laboratory with the colorimetric method using the Nessler solution. About 70% of the total amount of ammonia was emitted in the first two days immediately after manuring. The NH 3 flux was regulated by the same mechanism as the water vapour transport. Seventy percent of the daily ammonia was emitted around noon. The ammonia emission stopped during rainy and cold days and started again as soon as solar radiation, soil and air temperature increased, following plant decomposition. The total amount of ammonia emitted in the experimental period (28 days in 1995 and 18 days in 1996) was about 13 kg ha −1 for both years.

TI  - Long-term effects of organic amendments on soil fertility. A review
PY  - 2010
AB  - Common agricultural practices such as excessive use of agro-chemicals, deep tillage and luxury irrigation have degraded soils, polluted water resources and contaminated the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about interrelated environmental problems such as soil degradation, desertification, erosion, and accelerated greenhouse effects and climate change. The decline in organic matter content of many soils is becoming a major process of soil degradation, particularly in European semi-arid Mediterranean regions. Degraded soils are not fertile and thus cannot maintain sustainable production. At the same time, the production of urban and industrial organic waste materials is widespread. Therefore, strategies for recycling such organic waste in agriculture must be developed. Here, we review long-term experiments (3-60 years) on the effects of organic amendments used both for organic matter replenishment and to avoid the application of high levels of chemical fertilizers. The major points of our analysis are: (1) many effects, e.g. carbon sequestration in the soil and possible build-up of toxic elements, evolve slowly, so it is necessary to refer to long-term trials. (2) Repeated application of exogenous organic matter to cropland led to an improvement in soil biological functions. For instance, microbial biomass carbon increased by up to 100% using high-rate compost treatments, and enzymatic activity increased by 30% with sludge addition. (3) Long-lasting application of organic amendments increased organic carbon by up to 90% versus unfertilized soil, and up to 100% versus chemical fertilizer treatments. (4) Regular addition of organic residues, particularly the composted ones, increased soil physical fertility, mainly by improving aggregate stability and decreasing soil bulk density. (5) The best agronomic performance of compost is often obtained with the highest rates and frequency of applications. Furthermore, applying these strategies, there were additional beneficial effects such as the slow release of nitrogen fertilizer. (6) Crop yield increased by up to 250% by long-term applications of high rates of municipal solid waste compost. Stabilized organic amendments do not reduce the crop yield quality, but improve it. (7) Organic amendments play a positive role in climate change mitigation by soil carbon sequestration, the size of which is dependent on their type, the rates and the frequency of application. (8) There is no tangible evidence demonstrating negative impacts of heavy metals applied to soil, particularly when high-quality compost was used for long periods. (9) Repeated application of composted materials enhances soil organic nitrogen content by up to 90%, storing it for mineralization in future cropping seasons, often without inducing nitrate leaching to groundwater.

TI  - Climate change affects farm nitrogen loss - A Swiss case study with a dynamic farm model
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract The response of arable crops and grasslands to climatic changes and increasing CO2 concentration has implications for the operation of farms, in particular for the management of resources such as nitrogen. A simple dynamic farm model (Stella© model ‘CH-Farm’) was used to analyze the shift in the ratio of N lost via leaching, denitrification and volatilization to N exported with products from dairy or arable production (here defined as relative N loss). The model was run for two types of farms typical of Swiss conditions. Growth parameters for two sequentially grown crops (winter wheat and maize) and grass were determined with the process-oriented models Pasture Simulation Model (PaSim) and CropSyst, respectively. CH-Farm was forced with two assumptions about the transient change in temperature and precipitation, and with or without CO2 effects. Relative N loss for the baseline was around 1.33 for the dairy-type farm and around 1.05 for the arable-type farm and increased progressively over the 100-year simulation period, with the largest shift in response to the dry/hot scenario. Soil N pools decreased with all scenarios, but at different rates. CO2 fertilization alleviated the effect of climate change due to increased productivity and N fixation in plants. Adjustment of the growth parameters to progressively increasing temperatures reduced the difference between farm types and positively affected relative N losses mainly through increased productivity and reduced fallow periods between crops. The results suggest that the impact of climate change on relative farm-level N loss depends on physiological adjustments to climatic scenarios, whereas the distribution of land between dairy and arable crop production is less important, and that simple cultivar adjustments can help to mitigate negative effects of climate change on farm-level N use.

TI  - Can biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) genes from perennial Leymus racemosus (Triticeae) combat nitrification in wheat farming?
PY  - 2007
AB  - Using a recombinant luminescent Nitrosomonas europaea assay to quantify biological nitrification inhibition (BNI), we found that a wild relative of wheat (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tzvelev) had a high BNI capacity and releases about 20 times more BNI compounds (about 30 ATU g−1 root dry weight 24 h−1) than Triticum aestivum L. (cultivated wheat). The root exudate from cultivated wheat has no inhibitory effect on nitrification when applied to soil; however, the root exudate from L. racemous suppressed  formation and kept more than 90% of the soil’s inorganic-N in the -form for 60 days. The high-BNI capacity of L. racemosus is mostly associated with chromosome Lr#n. Two other chromosomes Lr#J, and Lr#I also have an influence on BNI production. Tolerance of L. racemosus to  is controlled by chromosome 7Lr#1-1. Sustained release of BNI compounds occurred only in the presence of  in the root environment. Given the level of BNI production expressed in DALr#n and assuming normal plant growth, we estimated that nearly 87,500,000 ATU of BNI activity ha−1 day−1 could be released in a field of vigorously growing wheat; this amounts to the equivalent of the inhibitory effect from the application of 52.5 g of the synthetic nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (one AT unit of BNI activity is equivalent to 0.6 μg of nitrapyrin). At this rate of BNI production it would take only 19 days for a BNI-enabled wheat crop to produce the inhibitory power of a standard commercial application of nitrapyrin, 1 kg ha−1. The synthetic nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide, blocked specifically the AMO (ammonia monooxygenase) pathway, while the BNI from L. racemosus blocked the HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase) pathway in Nitrosomonas. Here we report the first finding of high production of BNI in a wild relative of any cereal and its successful introduction and expression in cultivated wheat. These results demonstrate the potential for empowering the new generation of wheat cultivars with high-BNI capacity to control nitrification in wheat-production systems

TI  - Cover cropping affects soil N2O and CO2 emissions differently depending on type of irrigation
PY  - 2010
AB  - Agricultural management practices such as subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and winter legume cover cropping (WLCC) influence soil water dynamics as well as carbon and nitrogen cycling, potentially changing emission rates of soil CO2 and N2O, principal greenhouse gases. A split plot tomato field trial in California’s Central Valley was used to evaluate the use of SDI and WLCC on event-based CO2 and N2O emissions. SDI and WLCC were compared to the region’s more conventional practices: furrow irrigation (FI) and no cover crop (NCC). Our results indicate that SDI offers the potential to manage cover crops without the significant increases in greenhouse gas production during the growing season as seen under FI cover-cropped systems. The highest N2O emissions occurred during the beginning of the rainy season in November in the FI–WLCC treatment (5 mg m−2 h−1) and the lowest in August in the SDI–NCC treatments (4.87 gm −2 h −1 ). CO2 emissions ranged from 200 mg m −2 h −1 during the rainy season (winter) and >500 m−2 h−1 during the growing season. Though no differences were detected in CO2 emissions between irrigation practices, mean CO2 emissions under WLCC were 40% and 15% greater compared to NCC under FI and SDI, respectively. The treatment with the greatest effect on CO2 and N2O emissions was WLCC, which increased average growing season N2O and CO2 emissions under FI by 60 gN 2 Om −2 h −1

TI  - Considering the influence of sequestration duration and carbon saturation on estimates of soil carbon capacity
PY  - 2006
AB  - Rates of soil C sequestration have previously been estimated for a number of different land management activities, and these estimates continue to improve as more data become available. The time over which active sequestration occurs may be referred to as the sequestration duration. Integrating soil C sequestration rates with durations provides estimates of potential change in soil C capacity and more accurate estimates of the potential to sequester C. In agronomic systems, changing from conventional plow tillage to no-till can increase soil C by an estimated 16±3%, whereas increasing rotation intensity can increase soil C by an estimated 6±3%. The increase in soil C following a change in rotation intensity, however, may occur over a slightly longer period (26 yr) than that for tillage cessation (21 yr). Sequestration strategies for grasslands have, on average, longer sequestration durations (33 yr) than for croplands. Estimates for sequestration rates and durations are mean values and can differ greatly between individual sites and management practices. As the annual sequestration rate declines over the sequestration duration period, soil C approaches a new steady state. Sequestration duration is synonymous with the time to which soil C steady state is reached. However, soils could potentially sequester additional C following additional changes in management until the maximum soil C capacity, or soil C saturation, is achieved. Carbon saturation of the soil mineral fraction is not well understood, nor is it readily evident. We provide evidence of soil C saturation and we discuss how the steady state C level and the level of soil C saturation together influence the rate and duration of C sequestration associated with changes in land management.

TI  - Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers deplete soil nitrogen: a global dilemma for sustainable cereal production.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Cereal production that now sustains a world population of more than 6.5 billion has tripled during the past 40 yr, concurrent with an increase from 12 to 104 Tg yr(-1) of synthetic N applied largely in ammoniacal fertilizers. These fertilizers have been managed as a cost-effective form of insurance against low yields, without regard to the inherent effect of mineral N in promoting microbial C utilization. Such an effect is consistent with a net loss of soil organic C recently observed for the Morrow Plots, America's oldest experiment field, after 40 to 50 yr of synthetic N fertilization that substantially exceeded grain N removal. A similar decline in total soil N is reported herein for the same site and would be expected from the predominantly organic occurrence of soil N. This decline is in agreement with numerous long-term baseline data sets from chemical-based cropping systems involving a wide variety of soils, geographic regions, and tillage practices. The loss of organic N decreases soil productivity and the agronomic efficiency (kg grain kg(-1) N) of fertilizer N and has been implicated in widespread reports of yield stagnation or even decline for grain production in Asia. A major global evaluation of current cereal production systems should be undertaken, with a view toward using scientific and technological advances to increase input efficiencies. As one aspect of this strategy, the input of ammoniacal N should be more accurately matched to crop N requirement. Long-term sustainability may require agricultural diversification involving a gradual transition from intensive synthetic N inputs to legume-based crop rotations.

It provides a valuable compilation of current research, aimed at reconciling the environmental and economic components of Nitrogen cycling within the context of a productive agricultural industry. The book is divided into seven main sections, which examine systematically, the nature of the problems associated with losses of Nitrogen and a range of possible solutions. Section 1, &#39;Drivers towards sustainability-why change?&#39; identifies the need to adopt new strategies to avoid losses to the environment. Section 2 considers the options for &#39;Matching supply with demand&#39;, followed by the reasons for, and means of &#39;Controlling losses to air&#39; and to &#39;water&#39; in section 3 and 4. Section 5 describes the challenges of &#39;Reconciling productivity with environmental considerations&#39;. The remaining sections describe some mathematical models to assist the researcher, with the final section devoted to reports from the &#39;Themed Working Groups&#39; which debated the following topical questions: Organic matter: does it matter, or can technology overcome most problems related to soil fertility? Optimising Nitrogen additions: can we integrate fertilizer use and manure use? Controlling gaseous Nitrogen emissions: what is achievable? Missing Nitrogen: is the solution in dissolved Nitrogen? Pollution problems: mitigation, or are we swapping one form of pollution for another? System studies: do we need them, or can they be replaced by desktop studies? Model answers: can we improve their level of confidence and applicability? This book will be of value to researchers, policy makers and all those wishing to promote more efficient use of Nitrogen.

TI  - Subsoils: chemo-and biological denitrification, N2O and N2 emissions
PY  - 1998
AB  - Agricultural practices, soil characteristics and meteorological conditions are responsible for eventual nitrate accumulation in the subsoil. There is a lot of evidence that denitrification occurs in the subsoil and rates up to 60–70 kg ha-1 yr-1 might be possible. It has also been shown that in the presence of Fe2+ (formed through weathering of minerals) and an alkaline pH, nitrate can be chemically reduced. Another possible pathway of disappearance is through the formation of nitrite, which is unstable in acid conditions. With regard to the emission of N2O and N2, it can be stated that all conditions whereby the denitrification process becomes marginal are favourable for N2O formation rather than for N2. Because of its high solubility, however, an important amount of N2O might be transported with drainage water.

TI  - Direct N2O emissions following transition from conventional till to no-till in a cover cropped Mediterranean vineyard (Vitis vinifera)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Knowing underlying practices for current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a necessary precursor for developing best management practices aimed at reducing N2O emissions. The effect of no-till management on nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, remains largely unclear, especially in perennial agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to compare direct N2O emissions associated with management events in a cover-cropped Mediterranean vineyard under conventional tillage (CT) versus no-till (NT) practices. This study took place in a wine grape vineyard over one full growing season, with a focus on the seven to ten days following vineyard floor management and precipitation events. Cumulative N2O emissions in the NT system were greater under both the vine and the tractor row compared to CT, with 0.13 ± 0.021 kg N2O–N ha−1 growing season−1 emitted from the CT vine compared to 0.19 ± 0.017 kg N2O–N ha−1 growing season−1 emitted from the NT vine and 0.07 ± 0.041 kg N2O–N ha−1 growing season−1 emitted from the CT row compared to 0.11 ± 0.018 kg N2O–N ha−1 growing season−1 from the NT row. Yet these variations were not significant, indicating no differences in seasonal N2O emissions following conversion from CT to NT compared to long-term CT management. Individual management events such as fertilization and cover cropping, however, had a major impact on seasonal emissions, indicating that management events play a critical role in N2O emission patterns.

TI  - Methane oxidation in non-flooded soils as affected by crop production — invited paper
PY  - 2001
AB  - Methane is an important greenhouse gas, which contributes approximately 20% to global warming. The atmospheric CH4 concentration is increasing rapidly, resulting from an imbalance between CH4 production and consumption. The only known biological CH4 sinks are soils where methanotrophic bacteria consume CH4 by oxidizing it. For several reasons the CH4 uptake potential, particularly of arable soils and grassland, is only partly exploited, as several agricultural practices have adverse impacts on the activity of the CH4 oxidizing bacteria. The kind of land use in general has a remarkable influence with much higher oxidation rates under forest than under grassland or arable soil. Regular soil cultivation by ploughing and fertilization with ammonium or urea have been identified as main factors. Immediately after ammonium application the methanotrophic enzyme system is blocked, resulting in an inhibition of CH4 oxidation. In addition to this short-term effect a long-term effect exists after repeated ammonium fertilization, which is most likely caused by a shift in the population of soil microbes. Crop residues affect CH4 oxidation differently, depending on their C/N ratio: with a wide C/N ratio no effects are expected, whereas with a narrow C/N ratio strong inhibition was observed. Animal manure, particularly slurry, can cause CH4 emission immediately after application, whereas in the long run farmyard manure does not seem to have adverse impacts on CH4 oxidation. The methanotrophic activity decreased markedly with soil pH, although in many cases liming of acidified soils did not show a positive effect. Arable soils have a rather small pH range which allows CH4 oxidation, and the inhibitory effect of ammonium can partly result from a concomitant decrease in soil pH. Reduced tillage was identified as a measure to improve the methanotrophic activity of arable land, set aside of formerly ploughed soil points into the same direction. Plant growth itself is not primarily responsible for observed effects on CH4 oxidation, but secondary factors like differential pesticide treatments, changes in pH, or cultivation effects are more likely involved. Although for the overall CH4 fluxes the oxidation processes in agricultural soils are of minor importance, all available possibilities should be exhausted to improve or at least preserve their ability to oxidize CH4.

TI  - Soil respiration in conventional and no-tillage agroecosystems under different winter cover crop rotations
PY  - 1988
AB  - Carbon-dioxide efflux from conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) soils under winter ryegrain sorghum and crimson clover-grain sorghum rotations was measured for two consecutive cropping seasons using a static-absorption technique. Overall, CO2 output was significantly higher from NT than from CT soils, and from soils cropped to clover than from those cropped to rye. During the cool season, soil respiration was similar in NT and CT soils, and in an adjacent forest and old field. Carbon dioxide production ranged from 5 to 50 g CO2 m−2 day−1 over the 17 months of observation. Pulses of CO2 production were observed, following mowing of the winter crops, in both CT and NT. Plowing did not stimulate CO2 production in CT as was expected, but annual CO2 production in these systems may have been underestimated. Tillage appeared to affect the timing rather than the total amount of CO2 production. Linear regressions showed strong relationships between temperature and respiration in both CT (r = 0.88) and NT (r = 0.80) soils but not between soil moisture and respiration. However, soil moisture was significantly related to the contribution of surface residue to total respiration in NT (r = 0.80), suggesting that wetting and drying cycles may be more important to the decomposition of residues in NT than in CT.

TI  - Integrated Fertilizer and Irrigation Management to Reduce Nitrate Leaching in Central Spain
PY  - 2000
AB  - Cropping systems that fail to manage N and irrigation, with the objective of reducing losses of N, are frequently associated with elevated concentrations of nitrate N in soil and ground water. A long-term (4-yr) field experiment was carried out at La Poveda Field Station (30 km southeast of Madrid, Spain) with the objective of assessing whether the effect of traditional cultivation practices (irrigation and fertilization) can be reduced. The experiment was conducted on a Typic Xerofluvent soil and a crop sequence (corn-wheat-corn-oat) traditional in the area. Four fertilizer treatments (unfertilized check, urea, floranid [a slow-release N fertilizers and municipal organic waste [MOW] compost) were combined with two irrigation schedules (traditional and improved) in two sets of 24 plots. Seasonal drainage was estimated by the zero flux plane-water balance equation and nitrate concentration was measured at the soil depth of deep percolation (1.4 m) by a ceramic cup extraction system. Nitrate leaching could be attributed to both irrigation schedule and fertilizer type. Within fertilizer treatments, reductions of nitrate losses between irrigation schedules of 52, 51, 66, and 81% were found for the unfertilized check, urea, floranid, and MOW compost, respectively. Grain yields in the whole crop sequence were not affected by fertilizer or irrigation managements.

TI  - Ground-living spider assemblages from Mediterranean habitats under different management conditions
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ground-living spiders of different habitats in the Cabaneros National Park, central Spain, each under different management conditions, were studied to characterize their community richness and composition. Five different habitats were selected: Mediterranean forest, abandoned pine plantations and three kinds of dehesas or meadows (differing in their understory management). In three sampling periods, during two springs and one in fall (2001-2002), a total of 1,152 pitfall traps were deployed in five different habitats. A total of 3,801 adult spiders, representing 105 species from 24 families were collected, among which 13 are considered endemic for the Iberian Peninsula. Correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis showed that spider richness and assemblages differed considerably among the different habitats. The scrub dehesa had the highest ground-living spider richness. Twenty-three indicator species were identified for the different habitats, of which four are considered endemic for the Iberian Peninsula. Gnaphosidae have a high potential as indicators of habitat quality.

TI  - Tillage-induced CO2 emission from soil
PY  - 1997
AB  - The influence of agricultural production systems on greenhouse gas generation and emission is of interest as it may affect potential global climate change. Agricultural ecosystems can play a significant role in production and consumption of greenhouse gases, specifically, carbon dioxide. Information is needed on the mechanism and magnitude of gas generation and emission from agricultural soils with specific emphasis on tillage mechanisms. This work evaluated four different tillage methods on the short-term CO2 and water vapor flux from a clay loam soil in the Northern Cornbelt of the USA. The four tillage methods were moldboard plow only, moldboard plow plus disk harrow twice, disk harrow and chisel plow using standard tillage equipment following a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop compared with no tillage. The CO2 flux was measured with a large portable chamber commonly used to measure crop canopy gas exchange initiated within 5 minutes after tillage and continued intermittently for 19 days. The moldboard plow treatment buried nearly all of the residue and left the soil in a rough, loose, open condition and resulted in maximum CO2 loss. The carbon released as CO2 during the 19 days following the moldboard plow, moldboard plow plus disk harrow, disk harrow, chisel plow and not tilled treatments would account for 134%, 70%, 58%, 54% and 27% respectively of the carbon in the current year's crop residue. The short-term carbon dioxide losses 5 hours after four conservation tillage tools was only 31% of that of the moldboard plow. The moldboard plow lost 13.8 times as much CO2 as the soil area not tilled while different conservation tillage tools lost only 4.3 times. The smaller CO2 loss following conservation tillage tools is significant and suggests progress in developing conservation tillage tools that can enhance soil carbon management. Conservation tillage reduces the extent, frequency and magnitude of mechanical disturbance caused by the moldboard plow and reduces the air-filled macropores and slows the rate of carbon oxidation. Any effort to decrease tillage intensity and maximize residue return should result in carbon sequestration for enhanced environmental quality.

TI  - Stabilization mechanisms of soil organic matter: Implications for C-saturation of soils
PY  - 2002
AB  - The relationship between soil structure and the ability of soil to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) is a key element in soil C dynamics that has either been overlooked or treated in a cursory fashion when developing SOM models. The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53–250 μm sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs.

TI  - Soil organic carbon sequestration rates by tillage and crop rotation : A global data analysis
PY  - 2002
AB  - Changes in agricultural management can potentially increase the accumulation rate of soil organic C (SOC), thereby sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere. This study was conducted to quantify potential soil C sequestration rates for different crops in response to decreasing tillage intensity or enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the duration of time over which sequestration may occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were completed using a global database of 67 long-term agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a change from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) can sequester 57 ± 14 g C m -2 yr -1 , excluding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow systems which may not result in SOC accumulation with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation complexity can sequester an average 20 ± 12 g C m -2 yr -1 , excluding a change from continuous corn (Zea mays L.) to corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) which may not result in a significant accumulation of SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20 yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration rates, estimated for a number of individual crops and crop rotations in this study, can be used in spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict regional, national, and global C sequestration potentials.

TI  - Soil CO2 fluxes following tillage and rainfall events in a semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystem: Effects of tillage systems and nitrogen fertilization
PY  - 2010
AB  - 7 Pags.- 6 Figs.- 1 Tabl.The response of soil CO2 flux to tillage operations and rainfall events was studied under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. The study was conducted on a barley monoculture agro-ecosystem during summer/autumn fallow periods in four consecutive years (2005–2008). The study compared three N fertilization levels (zero, medium; 60 kg N ha−1; high, 120 kg N ha−1) under three tillage systems (NT, no-tillage; MT, minimum tillage; CT, conventional tillage). Tillage operations led to a pulse of soil CO2 flux. This pulse was linearly related to soil CO2 flux on the day before tillage operations under MT (slope = 4.22) and CT (slope = 16.7), indicating the extent of soil disturbances. However, the associated soil CO2-C losses during tillage operations were reduced and similar among different tillage systems. The soil CO2 flux after rainfall was higher under NT, where it was linearly related to soil temperatures (0.15 × soil temperature–1.06). Soil CO2 fluxes decreased on the following days as the soil dried. N fertilization affected CO2 flux in 5 out of 35 observation days, with higher fluxes with N fertilization under conservation tillage systems. Emissions after rainfall events led to large soil CO2-C losses, and these were of higher magnitude under conservation tillage systems (NT and MT).This work was supported with by the Comision Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Spain (Grants AGL 2004-07763-C02-02 and AGL2007-66320-CO2-02/AGR).

TI  - Dissolved and Soil Organic Carbon after Long‐Term Conventional and No‐Tillage Sorghum Cropping
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Distribution of dissolved (DOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) with depth may indicate soil and crop‐management effects on subsurface soil C sequestration. The objectives of this study were to investigate impacts of conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and cropping sequence on the depth distribution of DOC, SOC, and total nitrogen (N) for a silty clay loam soil after 20 years of continuous sorghum cropping. Conventional tillage consisted of disking, chiseling, ridging, and residue incorporation into soil, while residues remained on the soil surface for NT. Soil was sampled from six depth intervals ranging from 0 to 105 cm. Tillage effects on DOC and total N were primarily observed at 0–5 cm, whereas cropping sequence effects were observed to 55 cm. Soil organic carbon (C) was higher under NT than CT at 0–5 cm but higher under CT for subsurface soils. Dissolved organic C, SOC, and total N were 37, 36, and 66%, respectively, greater under NT than CT at 0–5 cm, and 171, 659, and 837% greater a...

TI  - Emissions of CO2, N2O, and NO in conventional and no-till management practices in Rondônia, Brazil
PY  - 2003
AB  - Efforts to restore productivity of pastures often employ agricultural management regimes involving either tillage or no-tillage options combined with various combinations of fertilizer application, herbicide use and the planting of a cash crop prior to the planting of forage grasses. Here we report on the emissions of CO2, N2O and NO from the initial phases (first 6 months) of three treatments in central Rondonia. The treatments were (1) control; (2) conventional tillage followed by planting of forage grass (Brachiaria brizantha) and fertilizer additions; (3) no-tillage/herbicide treatment followed by two plantings, the first being a cash crop of rice followed by forage grass. In treatment 3, the rice was fertilized. Relative to the control, tillage increased CO2 emission by 37% over the first 2 months, while the no-tillage/herbicide regime decreased CO2 emissions by 7% over the same period. The cumulative N2O emissions over the first 2 months from the tillage regime (0.94 kg N ha–1) were much higher than the N2O releases from either the no-tillage/herbicide regime (0.64 kg N ha–1) or the control treatment (0.04 kg N ha–1). The highest levels of N2O fluxes from both management regimes were observed following N fertilizations. The cumulative NO releases over the first 2 months were largest in the tillage treatment (0.98 kg N ha–1), intermediate in the no-tillage treatment (0.72 kg N ha–1), and smallest in the control treatment (0.12 kg N ha–1). For the first week following fertilization the percentage of fertilizer N lost as N2O plus NO was 1.0% for the tillage treatment and 3.0% for the no-tillage treatment.

TI  - Effects of fertiliser type and the presence or absence of plants on nitrous oxide emissions from irrigated soils
PY  - 2007
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and denitrification losses from an irrigated sandy loam soil amended with composted municipal solid waste (MSW), sheep manure (SM), surface applied pig slurry (SPS), incorporated pig slurry (IPS) or urea (U) were studied under Mediterranean conditions. We quantified emissions, in both the presence and absence of maize and N2O production, via denitrification and nitrification pathways using varying concentrations of acetylene. Discounting the N2O lost in the Control, the percentages of N2O lost in relation to the total N applied were greater for urea (1.80%) than for MSW (0.50%), SM (0.46%), SPS (1.02%) or IPS (1.27%). In general, plots treated with organic fertilisers emitted higher amounts of N2O when under maize than bare soil plots. On the other hand, greater denitrification losses were also recorded for plots in the absence of plants (between 9.7 and 29.3 kg N2O-N ha−1) than for areas with plants (between 7.1 and 24.1 kg N2O-N ha−1). The proportion of N2O produced via denitrification was greater from fertiliser treatments than for the controls and also greater without plants (between 66 and 91 % of the N2O emitted) than with plants (between 48 and 81%).

TI  - Determining Optimal Levels of Nitrogen Fertilizer Using Random Parameter Models
PY  - 2011
AB  - The parameters of yield response functions can vary by year. Past studies usually assume yield functions are nstochastic ‘‘limited’’ stochastic. In this study, we estimate rye– ryegrass yield functions in which all parameters are random. The three functional forms considered are the linear response plateau, the quadratic, and the Spillman-Mitscherlich. Nonstochastic yield models are rejected in favor of stochastic parameter models. Quadratic functional forms fit the data poorly. Optimal nitrogen application recommendations are calculated for the linear response plateau and Spillman-Mitscherlich. The stochastic models lead to smaller recommended levels of nitrogen, but the economic benefits of using fully stochastic crop yield functions are small because expected profit functions are relatively flat for the stochastic yield functions. Stochastic crop yield functions provide a way of incorporating production, uncertainty into input decisions.

TI  - Nitrogen oxides emission from soils bearing a potato crop as influenced by fertilization with treated pig slurries and composts
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and denitrification losses from an irrigated soil amended with organic fertilizers with different soluble organic carbon fractions and ammonium contents were studied in a field study covering the growing season of potato ( Solanum tuberosum ). Untreated pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), digested thin fraction of pig slurry (DTP), composted solid fraction of pig slurry (CP) and composted municipal solid waste (MSW) mixed with urea were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha −1 , and emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment without any added N fertilizer (Control). The cumulative denitrification losses correlated significantly with the soluble carbohydrates, dissolved N and total C added. Added dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved N affected the N 2 O/N 2 ratio, and a lower ratio was observed for organic fertilizers than from urea or unfertilized controls. The proportion of N 2 O produced from nitrification was higher from urea than from organic fertilizers. Accumulated N 2 O losses during the crop season ranged from 3.69 to 7.31 kg N 2 O–N ha −1 for control and urea, respectively, whereas NO losses ranged from 0.005 to 0.24 kg NO–N ha −1 , respectively. Digested thin fraction of pig slurry compared to IPS mitigated the total N 2 O emission by 48% and the denitrification rate by 33%, but did not influence NO emissions. Composted pig slurry compared to untreated pig slurry increased the N 2 O emission by 40% and NO emission by 55%, but reduced the denitrification losses (34%). DCD partially inhibited nitrification rates and reduced N 2 O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 83% and 77%, respectively. MSW+U, with a C:N ratio higher than that of the composted pig slurry, produced the largest denitrification losses (33.3 kg N ha −1 ), although N 2 O and NO emissions were lower than for the U and CP treatments. This work has shown that for an irrigated clay loam soil additions of treated organic fertilizers can mitigate the emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N 2 O in comparison with urea.

TI  - Nitrous oxide production kinetics during nitrate reduction in river sediments.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract A significant amount of nitrogen entering river basins is denitrified in riparian zones. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of nitrate and carbon concentrations on the kinetic parameters of nitrate reduction as well as nitrous oxide emissions in river sediments in a tributary of the Marne (the Seine basin, France). In order to determine these rates, we used flow-through reactors (FTRs) and slurry incubations; flow-through reactors allow determination of rates on intact sediment slices under controlled conditions compared to sediment homogenization in the often used slurry technique. Maximum nitrate reduction rates ( R m ) ranged between 3.0 and 7.1 μg N g −1  h −1 , and affinity constant (K m ) ranged from 7.4 to 30.7 mg N-NO 3 −  L −1 . These values were higher in slurry incubations with an R m of 37.9 μg N g −1  h −1 and a K m of 104 mg N-NO 3 −  L −1 . Nitrous oxide production rates did not follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and we deduced a rate constant with an average of 0.7 and 5.4 ng N g −1  h −1 for FTR and slurry experiments respectively. The addition of carbon (as acetate) showed that carbon was not limiting nitrate reduction rates in these sediments. Similar rates were obtained for FTR and slurries with carbon addition, confirming the hypothesis that homogenization increases rates due to release of and increasing access to carbon in slurries. Nitrous oxide production rates in FTR with carbon additions were low and represented less than 0.01% of the nitrate reduction rates and were even negligible in slurries. Maximum nitrate reduction rates revealed seasonality with high potential rates in fall and winter and low rates in late spring and summer. Under optimal conditions (anoxia, non-limiting nitrate and carbon), nitrous oxide emission rates were low, but significant (0.01% of the nitrate reduction rates).

TI  - Climate change impacts on agriculture and soil carbon sequestration potential in the Huang-Hai plain of China
PY  - 2005
AB  - For thousands of years, the Huang-Hai Plain in northeast China has been one of the most productive agricultural regions of the country. The future of this region will be determined in large part by how global climatic changes impact regional conditions and by actions taken to mitigate or adapt to climate change impacts. One potential mitigation strategy is to promote management practices that have the potential to sequester carbon in the soils. The IPCC estimates that 40 Pg of C could be sequestered in cropland soils worldwide over the next several decades; however, changes in global climate may impact this potential. Here, we assess the potential for soil C sequestration with conversion of a conventional till (CT) continuous wheat system to a wheat–corn double cropping system and by implementing no till (NT) management for both continuous wheat and wheat–corn systems. To assess the influence of these management practices under a changing climate, we use two climate change scenarios (A2 and B2) at two time periods in the EPIC agro-ecosystem simulation model. The applied climate change scenarios are from the HadCM3 global climate model for the periods 2015–2045 and 2070–2099 which projects consistent increases in temperature and precipitation of greater than 5 8C and up to 300 mm by 2099. An increase in the variability of temperature is also projected and is, accordingly, applied in the simulations. The EPIC model indicates that winter wheat yields would increase on average by 0.2 Mg ha � 1 in the earlier period and by 0.8 Mg ha � 1 in the later period due to warmer nighttime temperatures and higher precipitation. Simulated yields were not significantly affected by imposed changes in crop management. Simulated soil organic C content was higher under both NT management and double cropping than under CT continuous wheat. The simulated changes in management were a more important factor in SOC changes than the scenario of climate change. Soil C sequestration rates for continuous wheat systems were increased by an average of 0.4 Mg ha � 1 year � 1 by NT in the earlier period and by 0.2 Mg ha � 1 year � 1 in the later period. With wheat–corn double cropping, NT increased sequestration rates by 0.8 and 0.4 Mg ha � 1 year � 1 for the earlier and later periods, respectively. The total C offset due to a shift from CT to NT under continuous wheat over 16 million hectares in the Huang-Hai Plain is projected to reach 240 Tg C in the earlier period and 180 Tg C in the later period. Corresponding C offsets for wheat–corn cropping are 675–495 Tg C. # 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental impacts of grazed clover/grass pastures
PY  - 2009
AB  - Grazed clover/grass pastures are important for animal production systems and the clover component is critical for its contribution to N inputs via biological fixation of atmospheric N 2 . The resource efficiency and environmental emissions for clover/grass pastures can differ from that of N-fertilised grass-only pastures. Fixation of N 2 by clover uses photosynthetically-fixed carbon, whereas fertiliser N production consumes fossil fuels and has net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Clover has a higher phosphorus (P) requirement than grass and where extra P fertiliser is used for clover/grass pastures the risk of P loss to waterways is greater than for grass-only pastures. Nitrogen leaching from grazed pasture increases exponentially with increased N inputs and urinary-N contributes 70 to 90% of total N leaching. However, the few studies comparing clover/grass and N-fertilised grass-only pastures at similar total N inputs indicated similar N leaching losses. Nitrous oxide emissions from grazed pastures due to N-cycling of excreta are similar for clover/grass and N-fertilised grass-only pastures at similar total N inputs. However, grass-only pasture requires the application of N fertiliser, which will result in additional specific losses that don’t occur from clover-fixed N. Thus, total N 2 O emissions are generally higher for N-fertilised grass pastures than for clover/grass pastures. A summary of various whole-system and life cycle assessment analyses for dairy farms from various countries indicated that at similar total N inputs, clover/grass pasture systems can be more efficient than N-fertilised grass systems per kilogram of milk produced from an energy use and GHG perspective whereas results for nutrient losses to waterways were mixed and appear to be similar for both pasture types. In practice, other management practices on farm, such as crop integration, supplementary feeding strategy and winter management, can have a larger overall effect on environmental emissions than whether the N input is derived from fertiliser N or from N 2 fixation.

TI  - Nitrogen use efficiency with the application of controlled release fertilizers coated with Kraft pine lignin
PY  - 1997
AB  - Abstract The aim of the present paper is to assess the efficiency of several experimental fertilizers in a soil-plant system. The laboratory-prepared fertilizers consisted of granular urea coated with Kraft pine lignin. Five fertilizers were used with coatings differing in thickness and/or the addition of linseed oil as a sealing agent. The experiment was carried out in pots inside a glasshouse. The crop used was rye-grass. Results were compared with those from a urea control treatment without coating and a soil without fertilizer application. The dry matter yield and the N uptake by the plant were higher in the treatments with coated controlled release fertilizers (CRF) than in those with uncoated urea. There was a lower nitrogen loss through leaching when using CRF (34 to 68%) was used than when using uncoated urea (over 74%) was used. The N use efficiency was lower for urea than for coated fertilizers. This index increased with the thickness of the coating and the addition of the sealing agent.

TI  - Integrated assessment of promising measures to decrease nitrogen losses from agriculture in EU-27
PY  - 2009
AB  - Following the recognition of the detrimental effects of nitrogen (N) losses from agriculture in the European Union (EU) on human health and environment, series of environmental policy measures have been implemented from the early 1990s onwards. However, these measures have only been partially successful. Clearly, there is lack of integration of available measures and there is lack of enforcement and hierarchy; which measures should be implemented first? We identified and assessed three ‘most promising measures’ to decrease N losses from agriculture, i.e., (i) balanced fertilization, (ii) low-protein animal feeding, and (iii) ammonia (NH3) emissions abatement measures. Environmental-economic assessments were made using scenario analyses and the modeling tools MITERRA-EUROPE and CAPRI. In the baseline scenario (business as usual), N use efficiency (NUE) in crop production increases from 44% in 2000 to 48% in 2020, while total N losses decrease by 10%. Implementation of promising measures increases NUE further to 51–55%, and decreases NH3 emissions (by up to 23%), nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (by up to 10%) and N leaching losses (by up to 35%). Differences in responsiveness to promising measures varied between and within Member States. Strict implementation of balanced fertilization in nitrate vulnerable zones, as defined in the Nitrates Directive, decreases total farmers’ income in EU-27 by 1.7 billion euros per year. Implementation of all three measures decreases farmers income by 10.8 and total welfare by 17 billion euros per year, without valuing the environmental benefits. The study presented here is one of the first EU-wide integrated assessments of the effects of policy measures on all major N losses from agriculture and their economic costs. Our results show that the most promising measures are effective in enhancing NUE and decreasing NH3 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere and N leaching to groundwater and surface waters, but that income effects are significant. The order of implementation of the measures is important; NH3 emissions abatement measures must be implemented together with balanced N fertilization.

TI  - Managing carbon in a multiple use world: The implications of land-use decision context for carbon management
PY  - 2013
AB  - Human land use contributes significantly to the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Changes in land management practices have been proposed as a critical and cost-effective mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the storage of additional carbon in vegetation and soils. However many discussions of the potential for land use to mitigate climate change only take into account biophysical factors such as vegetation and land cover and neglect how the agency of land owners themselves affects whether additional carbon storage can be achieved. Unlike many potential REDD opportunities in developing countries, land management in the U.S. to enhance carbon sequestration would occur against a backdrop of clearly defined, legally enforceable land ownership. In addition, more than a third of the land surface in the U.S. is managed by federal agencies who operate under legal guidelines for multiple use and is subject to demands from multiple constituencies. We set out to investigate how the goal of enhancing carbon sequestration through land use is perceived or implemented in one region of the U.S., and how this goal might intersect the existing drivers and incentives for public and private land use decision making. We conducted a case study through interviews of the major categories of landowners in the state of Colorado, which represents a mixture of public and privately held lands. By analyzing trends in interview responses across categories, we found that managing for carbon is currently a fairly low priority and we identify several barriers to more widespread consideration of carbon as a management priority including competing objectives, limited resources, lack of information, negative perceptions of offsetting and lack of a sufficient policy signal. We suggest four avenues for enhancing the potential for carbon to be managed through land use including clarifying mandates for public lands, providing compelling incentives for private landowners, improving understanding of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of managing for carbon, and creating more usable science to support decision making.

TI  - Comparison of N losses (NO − 3 , N 2 O, NO) from surface applied, injected or amended (DCD) pig slurry of an irrigated soil in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 2005
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N 2O), nitric oxide (NO), denitrification losses and NO−3 leaching from an irrigated sward were quantified under Mediterranean conditions. The effect of injected pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) was evaluated and also compared with that of a surface pig slurry application (SPS) and a control treatment (Control) without fertiliser. After application, fluxes of NO and N 2O peaked from SPS (3.06 mg NO-N m −2 d −1 and 108 mg N 2O-N m −2 d −1) and IPS (3.50 mg NO-N m −2 d −1 and 105 mg N 2O-N m −2 d −1). However, when irrigation was applied, N 2O and NO emissions declined. The total N 2O and denitrification losses were slightly large from IPS than from SPS, although the differences were not significant (P < 0.05). Emission of NO was not affected by the method of pig slurry application. DCD inhibited nitrification during the first 20–30 days and reduced N 2O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 46% and 37%, respectively. Considering the 215 days following pig slurry application, the emission factor of N 2O based on N fertiliser was 1.60% (SPS), 2.95% (IPS), and 0.50% (IPS + DCD). The emission factor for NO was 0.14% (SPS), 0.12% (IPS), and 0.02% (IPS + DCD). Environmental conditions of the crop favoured the denitrification process as the most important source of N 2O during the experimental period. The differences in the denitrification rate between treatments could be explained by the pattern of water soluble carbon (WSC), that was the highest value in injected pig slurry (with and without DCD). Due to low drainage (5% of water applied), leaching losses of NO

 were lower than those of denitrification from the upper soil layer (0–10 cm) in all treatments and especially with IPS + DCD, where the nitrification inhibitor was very efficient in reducing leaching losses.

TI  - Improvement of soil properties and nitrogen utilisation of sunflower by amending municipal solid waste compost
PY  - 2005
AB  - We studied the effects of municipal solid waste compost applied to soil on sunflower nitrogen (N) uptake, N utilisation, yield, soil mineral N deficit and soil characteristics. One unfertilised control was compared with the optimal N dose for the sunflower crops in the test area (100 kg N ha -1 ) supplied as: organic fertilisation, with municipal solid waste compost; mineral fertilisation, with ammonium nitrate; and mixed fertilisation, with 50 kg N ha -1 from compost and 50 kg N ha -1 from mineral nitrogen. The results obtained showed that the compost, at the end of the experiment, modified the soil chemical properties. In particular, it significantly improved available phosphorus (111.3% increase for compost treatment in respect to 57.6% for the control), maintained almost the same level of exchangeable potassium (6.0% reduction for compost treatment in respect to 9.8% for the control), and significantly enhanced total soil organic matter (50.0% vs. 32.1%) and extracted organic carbon (16.6% vs. 11.8%). In addition, the application of this material did not increase the total content of heavy metals. The results showed that the municipal waste compost did not modify N uptake, utilisation, or efficiency of sunflower plants. The mean value of N uptake during the vegetative stage was 60.9%, while postanthesis N uptake reached only 39.1% and was positively and significantly correlated with yields and total N uptake, showing that the late N absorption could influence yield performance of sunflower cropped in Mediterranean conditions. Furthermore, the compost, alone or in association with mineral fertiliser, allowed similar yield performance as mineral fertilisation in oil yield (1.51, 1.48 and 1.58 t ha -1 , for the three treatments, respectively) and protein yield (0.66, 0.64 and 0.65 t ha -1 , respectively).

TI  - Elevated CO2 stimulates N2O emissions in permanent grassland
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract To evaluate climate forcing under increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, feedback effects on greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N 2 O) with a high global warming potential should be taken into account. This requires long-term N 2 O flux measurements because responses to elevated CO 2 may vary throughout annual courses. Here, we present an almost 9 year long continuous N 2 O flux data set from a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) study on an old, N-limited temperate grassland. Prior to the FACE start, N 2 O emissions were not different between plots that were later under ambient (A) and elevated (E) CO 2 treatments, respectively. However, over the entire experimental period (May 1998–December 2006), N 2 O emissions more than doubled under elevated CO 2 (0.90 vs. 2.07 kg N 2 O-N ha −1  y −1 under A and E, respectively). The strongest stimulation occurred during vegetative growth periods in the summer when soil mineral N concentrations were low. This was surprising because based on literature we had expected the highest stimulation of N 2 O emissions due to elevated CO 2 when mineral N concentrations were above background values (e.g. shortly after N application in spring). N 2 O emissions under elevated CO 2 were moderately stimulated during late autumn–winter, including freeze–thaw cycles which occurred in the 8th winter of the experiment. Averaged over the entire experiment, the additional N 2 O emissions caused by elevated CO 2 equaled 4738 kg CO 2 -equivalents ha −1 , corresponding to more than half a ton (546 kg) of CO 2  ha −1 which has to be sequestered annually to balance the CO 2 -induced N 2 O emissions. Without a concomitant increase in C sequestration under rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, temperate grasslands may be converted into greenhouse gas sources by a positive feedback on N 2 O emissions. Our results underline the need to include continuous N 2 O flux measurements in ecosystem-scale CO 2 enrichment experiments.

TI  - Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world
PY  - 1996
AB  - Summary
The soil is important in sequestering atmospheric CO2 and in emitting trace gases (e.g. CO2, CH4 and N2O) that are radiatively active and enhance the ‘greenhouse’ effect. Land use changes and predicted global warming, through their effects on net primary productivity, the plant community and soil conditions, may have important effects on the size of the organic matter pool in the soil and directly affect the atmospheric concentration of these trace gases.

A discrepancy of approximately 350 × 1015 g (or Pg) of C in two recent estimates of soil carbon reserves worldwide is evaluated using the geo-referenced database developed for the World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials (WISE) project. This database holds 4353 soil profiles distributed globally which are considered to represent the soil units shown on a 1/2° latitude by 1/2° longitude version of the corrected and digitized 1:5 M FAO–UNESCO Soil Map of the World.

Total soil carbon pools for the entire land area of the world, excluding carbon held in the litter layer and charcoal, amounts to 2157–2293 Pg of C in the upper 100 cm. Soil organic carbon is estimated to be 684–724 Pg of C in the upper 30 cm, 1462–1548 Pg of C in the upper 100 cm, and 2376–2456 Pg of C in the upper 200 cm. Although deforestation, changes in land use and predicted climate change can alter the amount of organic carbon held in the superficial soil layers rapidly, this is less so for the soil carbonate carbon. An estimated 695–748 Pg of carbonate-C is held in the upper 100 cm of the world's soils. Mean C: N ratios of soil organic matter range from 9.9 for arid Yermosols to 25.8 for Histosols. Global amounts of soil nitrogen are estimated to be 133–140 Pg of N for the upper 100 cm. Possible changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen dynamics caused by increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and the predicted associated rise in temperature are discussed.

TI  - Short-term influence of tillage on CO2 fluxes from a semi-arid soil on the Canadian prairies
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract The flux of CO 2 from soil determines the extent to which carbon (C) deposited as plant litter is retained in the soil. Retention of soil C is beneficial for soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and is essential if soils are to be used as a repository of C to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 increases. Although tillage is assumed to have a major influence on soil C retention, the extent to which tillage enhances the transfer of soil C to the atmosphere is uncertain. We assessed the short-term (50 h) influence of tillage on CO 2 fluxes from Chernozemic soils under a two-year wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)-summerfallow rotation in a semi-arid region of the Canadian Prairie. The tillage effect and its persistence were assessed by using a portable CO 2 analyzer to record several temporal series of CO 2 fluxes, along undisturbed and tilled transects, at successive time intervals (from −0.5 to 50 h) after a single pass with a heavy-duty cultivator. Immediately after tillage, CO 2 fluxes along the tilled transects increased from 2 to 4-fold above pre-tillage fluxes, but the increases were short-lived and fluxes along undisturbed and tilled transects were again similar within 24 h of cultivation. Total amounts of CO 2 released by a tillage operation were quantified by: 1. linear interpolations among successive fluxes along tilled and undisturbed transects, and 2. by fitting a model to successive differences between fluxes along the transects. 
Both methods estimated the amounts of tillage-susceptible CO 2 to be in the range of 3.6–7.2 kg C ha −1 . The tillage-induced flush of CO 2 was attributed mainly to enhanced transport of CO 2 already in the soil, but enhanced production of CO 2 by heterotrophic soil organisms also may have contributed to the flush. Regardless of the sources of CO 2 released by single tillage operations, amounts of tillage-susceptible soil C were minor; even 10 passes with a cultivator would account for less than 5% of annual soil CO 2 emissions or crop residue production in these cropping systems. Our study suggested that the short-term influence of tillage on the transfer of soil C to atmospheric CO 2 is small under semi-arid conditions like those in southern Alberta, Canada.

TI  - Effects of organic and inorganic fertilization on growth, yield and nicotine content of flue-cured and oriental tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) seedlings grown in organic and conventional float system
PY  - 2010
AB  - Organic tobacco consists of a new industrial crop product. Also, organic transplant production is the major problem for organic agriculture in Greece. Thus, field experiments were conducted to determine (a) the effects of organic and conventional float systems on tobacco seedlings quality and (b) the effect of organic and inorganic fertilization on the growth, yield and nicotine content of flue-cured and oriental type of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Experiment (a) was conducted as complete randomized block design with three replicates and two treatments (organic and conventional float system). Experiment (b) was conducted as split plot design with three replicates, two main plots (flue-cured and oriental tobacco) and two sub-plots (organic and inorganic fertilizers). Our results (Experiment a) clearly indicate that there were no significant differences between the organic and conventional float systems for root biomass of tobacco seedlings. Conventional fertilization treatment is responsible for the production of seedlings with high water content (82-83%). Moreover, in both tobacco types (Experiment b), there were no significant differences between the organic and inorganic fertilization concerning the height and yield of tobacco crop. The yield in the oriental tobacco was less than in the Virginia tobacco type. In both tobacco types the use of organic fertilizer increased the nicotine content and N% of leaves. High correlation coefficient (r = 0.88, p<0.001) between N% and nicotine content of leaves was found. The nicotine content of leaves in oriental tobacco type was always higher than that in Virginia type. Controlled release of nitrogen in organic fertilizers may be a useful practice for increasing nicotine content in tobacco crop.

TI  - Carbon input and soil carbon dioxide emission affected by land use and management practices
PY  - 2010
AB  - Land use and management practices may influence carbon inputs and soil CO2 emissions, a greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. C inputs and soil CO2 emissions were monitored from crop and grassland with various irrigation and cropping systems from 2006 to 2008 in western North Dakota, USA. Treatments were two irrigation systems (irrigated and non-irrigated) and six cropping systems [conventional-tilled barley with N (CTBFN), conventional-tilled barley with no N (CTBON), no-tilled barley-pea with N (NTB-PN), no-tilled barley with N (NTBFN), no-tilled barley with no N (NTBON), and no-tilled Conservation Reserve Program (grassland) (NTCRP)]. Crop residue C was greater in irrigated than in non-irrigated systems and greater in CTBFN and NTBFN than in other cropping systems. Soil CO2 flux varied with time of measurement in various irrigation and cropping systems. Total CO2 flux from May to October was greater in irrigated than in non-irrigated systems and greater in NTCRP than in other treatments. Differences in crop C inputs, root and soil respiration, and soil temperature and water content can result in variations in CO2 emissions among management practices and land use.

TI  - The effects of manure and nitrogen fertilizer applications on soil organic carbon and nitrogen in a high-input cropping system.
PY  - 2014
AB  - With the goal of improving N fertilizer management to maximize soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and minimize N losses in high-intensity cropping system, a 6-years greenhouse vegetable experiment was conducted from 2004 to 2010 in Shouguang, northern China. Treatment tested the effects of organic manure and N fertilizer on SOC, total N (TN) pool and annual apparent N losses. The results demonstrated that SOC and TN concentrations in the 0-10cm soil layer decreased significantly without organic manure and mineral N applications, primarily because of the decomposition of stable C. Increasing C inputs through wheat straw and chicken manure incorporation couldn't increase SOC pools over the 4 year duration of the experiment. In contrast to the organic manure treatment, the SOC and TN pools were not increased with the combination of organic manure and N fertilizer. However, the soil labile carbon fractions increased significantly when both chicken manure and N fertilizer were applied together. Additionally, lower optimized N fertilizer inputs did not decrease SOC and TN accumulation compared with conventional N applications. Despite the annual apparent N losses for the optimized N treatment were significantly lower than that for the conventional N treatment, the unchanged SOC over the past 6 years might limit N storage in the soil and more surplus N were lost to the environment. Consequently, optimized N fertilizer inputs according to root-zone N management did not influence the accumulation of SOC and TN in soil; but beneficial in reducing apparent N losses. N fertilizer management in a greenhouse cropping system should not only identify how to reduce N fertilizer input but should also be more attentive to improving soil fertility with better management of organic manure.

TI  - Effect of management, climate and soil conditions on N2O and NO emissions from an arable crop rotation using high temporal resolution measurements
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Quantifying the nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes emitted from croplands remains a major challenge. Field measurements in different climates, soil and agricultural conditions are still scarce and emissions are generally assessed from a small number of measurements. In this study, we report continuously measured N2O and NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over a 2-year crop sequence of barley and maize in northern France. Measurements were carried out using 6 automatic chambers at a rate of 16 mean flux measurements per day. Additional laboratory measurements on soil cores were conducted to study the response of NO and N2O emissions to environmental conditions. The detection limit of the chamber setup was found to be 3 ng N m−2 s−1 for N2O and 0.1 ng N m−2 s−1 for NO. Nitrous oxide fluxes were higher than the threshold 37% of the time, while they were 72% of the time for NO fluxes. The cumulated annual NO and N2O emissions were 1.7 kg N2O-N ha−1 and 0.5 kg NO-N ha−1 in 2007, but 2.9 kg N2O-N ha−1 and 0.7 kg NO-N ha−1 in 2008. These inter-annual differences were largely related to crop types and to their respective management practices. The forms, amounts and timing of nitrogen applications and the mineralization of organic matter by incorporation of crop residues were found to be the main factor controlling the emissions peaks. The inter-annual variability was also due to different weather conditions encountered in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the fractioned N inputs applied on barley (54 kg ha−1 in March and in April) did not generate N2O emissions peaks because of the low rainfall during the spring. However, the significant rainfall observed in the summer and fall of 2007, promoted rapid decomposition of barley residues which caused high levels of N2O emissions. In 2008, the application of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer before the emergence of maize (107 kg Nmin ha−1 or 130 kg Ntot ha−1 in all) coincided with large rainfalls promoting both NO and N2O emissions, which remained high until early summer. Laboratory measurements corroborated the field observations: NO fluxes were maximum at a water-filled pore space (WFPS) of around 27% while N2O fluxes were optimal at 68% WFPS, with a maximum potentially 14 times larger than for NO.

TI  - Nitrogen-use efficiency : a biologically meaningful definition?
PY  - 1987
AB  - A parameter to measure the efficiency of nitrogen use should include 1) the mean residence time of the N in the plant, ie the period during which the absorbed N can be used for C-fixation; and 2) the instantaneous rate of C-fixation per unit of N in the plant. It is essential to distinguish between these components of the nitrogen-use-efficiency, as they make 2 conflicting demands upon the N allocation within the plant.-

TI  - Impacts of set-aside policy on the risk of soil erosion in central Spain
PY  - 2005
AB  - The 1992 European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) set-aside program led to an increase in area of set-aside land after 1992, but had a varying effect on soil erosion rates because of the different climatic, environmental and economic conditions of European agricultural regions. This study presents new data on the CAP implications for land use and management on subsidized-dependent agricultural zones of central Spain. The focus is on how this land change has impacted the soil erosion risk since 1992. In many parts of cereal-growing central Spain, with Mediterranean continental climate, set-aside land management is managed as unseeded fallow, a management type used to increase soil moisture and fertility for subsequent rotations. Unseeded fallow land management has also been related to increased susceptibility to soil erosion. In order to quantify the effects CAP reform policies have had on erosion rates, land changes from 1991 to 1998 were used to calculate annual rates of erosion susceptibility using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment within a study watershed. Additional land use scenarios were simulated to estimate the effects fallow land modification would have on erosion risk. The results show the increase in unseeded fallow land management, due to the 1992 EU policy, led to an increase in the amount of land in high erosion risk categories. Although the increase in set-aside land due to the CAP has resulted in less area vulnerable to soil erosion in some regions of Europe, the agricultural regions of central Spain have experienced the opposite.

TI  - Soil CO2 fluxes from direct seeding rice fields under two tillage practices in central China
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Agricultural practices affect the production and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from paddy soils. It is crucial to understand the effects of tillage and N fertilization on soil CO2 flux and its influencing factors for a better comprehension of carbon dynamics in subtropical paddy ecosystems. A 2-yr field study was conducted to assess the effects of tillage (conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT]) and N fertilization (0 and 210 kg N ha−1) on soil CO2 fluxes during the 2008 and 2009 rice growing seasons in central China. Treatments were established following a split-plot design of a randomized complete block with tillage practices as the main plot and N fertilizer level as the split-plot treatment. The soil CO2 fluxes were measured 24 times in 2008 and 17 times in 2009. N fertilization did not affect soil CO2 emissions while tillage affected soil CO2 emissions, where NT had similar soil CO2 emissions to CT in 2008, but in 2009, NT significantly increased soil CO2 emissions. Cumulative CO2 emissions were 2079–2245 kg CO2–C ha−1 from NT treatments, and 2084–2141 kg CO2–C ha−1 from CT treatments in 2008, and were 1257–1401 kg CO2–C ha−1 from NT treatments, and 1003–1034 kg CO2–C ha−1 from CT treatments in 2009, respectively. Cumulative CO2 emissions were significantly related to aboveground biomass and soil organic C. Before drainage of paddy fields, soil CO2 fluxes were significantly related to soil temperature with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.67–0.87 in 2008 and 0.69–0.85 in 2009; moreover, the Q10 values ranged from 1.28 to 1.55 and from 2.10 to 5.21 in 2009, respectively. Our results suggested that NT rice production system appeared to be ineffective in decreasing carbon emission, which suggested that CO2 emissions from integrated rice-based system should be taken into account to assess effects of tillage.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions in livestock production systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Agriculture is responsible for a significant proportion of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (perhaps 18% globally), and therefore has the potential to contribute to efforts to reduce emissions as a means of minimising the risk of dangerous climate change. The largest contributions to emissions are attributed to ruminant methane production and nitrous oxide from animal waste and fertilised soils. Further, livestock, including ruminants, are an important component of global and Australian food production and there is a growing demand for animal protein sources. At the same time as governments and the community strengthen objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are growing concerns about global food security. This paper provides an overview of a number of options for reducing methane and nitrous oxide emissions from ruminant production systems in Australia, while maintaining productivity to contribute to both objectives. Options include strategies for feed modification, animal breeding and herd management, rumen manipulation and animal waste and fertiliser management. Using currently available strategies, some reductions in emissions can be achieved, but practical commercially available techniques for significant reductions in methane emissions, particularly from extensive livestock production systems, will require greater time and resource investment. Decreases in the levels of emissions from these ruminant systems (i.e., the amount of emissions per unit of product such as meat) have already been achieved. However, the technology has not yet been developed for eliminating production of methane from the rumen of cattle and sheep digesting the cellulose and lignin-rich grasses that make up a large part of the diet of animals grazing natural pastures, particularly in arid and semi-arid grazing lands. Nevertheless, the abatement that can be achieved will contribute significantly towards reaching greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and research will achieve further advances.

TI  - Mechanisms of N2O production following chloropicrin fumigation
PY  - 2005
AB  - Soil fumigation has recently been shown to affect the greenhouse gas balance by increasing emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) following chloropicrin (CP) application. However, the exact mechanisms of this increase were not investigated. The purpose of this study was to elucidate potential mechanisms of CP-induced N2O production through laboratory incubations using chemical inhibitors (acetylene, antibacterial, antifungal, and oxygen), isotopically labeled 15N-CP, and pH modifications of a forest nursery soil. Results showed that N2O production increased by 12.6 times following CP fumigation. Microbial activity contributed 82% to the CP-induced N2O production, with the remaining 18% from abiotic processes as determined by incubation with sterilized soil. Inhibitor studies suggested that 20% of the N2O production was from bacteria and 70% from fungi. There were no significant differences in N2O production following CP fumigation under various levels of acetylene (0, 10, and 10 kPa), suggesting that traditional nitrification and denitification reactions did not significantly contribute to N2O production following CP fumigation. 15N labeled studies indicated that 12% of fumigant source N was incorporated into the produced N2O. No enrichment in N2 was observed, indicating that N2O was one of the terminal biotic mineralization products of CP. Production of N2O is aerobic and production rates increased with increasing oxygen concentrations. Our data strongly suggested that fungal mediated denitrification reactions under aerobic conditions were the primary mechanism for CP-induced N2O production.

TI  - Crop residues and fertilizer nitrogen influence residue decomposition and nitrous oxide emission from a Vertisol
PY  - 2010
AB  - Crop residues with high C/N ratio immobilize N released during decomposition in soil, thus reducing N losses through leaching, denitrification, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 84 days under controlled conditions (24°C and moisture content 55% of water-holding capacity) to study the influence of sugarcane, maize, sorghum, cotton and lucerne residues, and mineral N addition, on N mineralization–immobilization and N2O emission. Residues were added at the rate of 3 t C ha−1 to soil with, and without, 150 kg urea N ha−1. The addition of sugarcane, maize, and sorghum residues without N fertilizer resulted in a significant immobilization of soil N. Amended soil had significantly (P < 0.05) lower NO 3 − –N, which reached minimum values of 2.8 mg N kg−1 for sugarcane (at day 28), 10.3 mg N kg−1 for maize (day 7), and 5.9 mg N kg−1 for sorghum (day 7), compared to 22.7 mg N kg−1 for the unamended soil (day 7). During 84 days of incubation, the total mineral N in the residues + N treatments were decreased by 45 mg N kg−1 in sugarcane, 34 mg kg−1 in maize, 29 mg kg−1 in sorghum, and 16 mg kg−1 in cotton amended soil compared to soil + N fertilizer, although soil NO 3 − –N increased by 7 mg kg−1 in lucerne amended soil. The addition of residues also significantly increased amended soil microbial biomass C and N. Maximum emissions of N2O from crop residue amended soils occurred in the first 4–5 days of incubation. Overall, after 84 days of incubation, the cumulative N2O emission was 25% lower with cotton + N fertilizer, compared to soil + N fertilizer. The cumulative N2O emission was significantly and positively correlated with NO 3 − –N (r = 0.92, P < 0.01) and total mineral N (r = 0.93, P < 0.01) after 84 days of incubation, and had a weak but significant positive correlation with cumulative CO2 in the first 3 and 5 days of incubation (r = 0.59, P < 0.05).

TI  - Soil nitrous oxide and methane fluxes are low from a bioenergy crop (canola) grown in a semi-arid climate.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Understanding nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes from agricultural soils in semi-arid climates is necessary to fully assess greenhouse gas emissions from bioenergy cropping systems, and to improve our knowledge of global terrestrial gaseous exchange. Canola is grown globally as a feedstock for biodiesel production, however, resulting soil greenhouse gas fluxes are rarely reported for semi-arid climates. We measured soil N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes from a rain-fed canola crop in a semi-arid region of south-western Australia for 1 year on a subdaily basis. The site included N fertilized (75 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) and nonfertilized plots. Daily N 2 O fluxes were low (-1.5 to 4.7 g N 2 O-N ha -1 day -1 ) and culminated in an annual loss of 128 g N 2 O-N ha -1 (standard error, 12 g N 2 O-N ha -1 ) from N fertilized soil and 80 g N 2 O-N ha -1 (standard error, 11 g N 2 O-N ha -1 ) from nonfertilized soil. Daily CH 4 fluxes were also low (-10.3 to 11.9 g CH 4 -C ha-1 day -1 ), and did not differ with treatments, with an average annual net emission of 6.7 g CH 4 -C ha-1 (standard error, 20 g CH 4 -Cha -1 ). Greatest daily N 2 O fluxes occurred when the soil was fallow, and following a series of summer rainfall events. Summer rainfall increased soil water contents and available N, and occurred when soil temperatures were > 25°C, and when there was no active plant growth to compete with soil microorganisms for mineralized N; conditions known to promote N 2 O production. The proportion of N fertilizer emitted as N 2 O, after correction for emissions from the no N fertilizer treatment, was 0.06%; 17 times lower than IPCC default value for the application of synthetic N fertilizers to land (1.0%). Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from bioenergy crop production in semi-arid regions are likely to have less influence on the net global warming potential of biofuel production than in temperate climates.

TI  - Controls of bioavailability and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter in soils
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract In soils, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is probably the most bioavailable fraction of soil organic matter, since all microbial uptake mechanisms require a water environment. Bioavailability describes the potential of microorganisms to interact with DOM. It is a prerequisite for biodegradation and can be restricted, if DOM is present in small pores or within soil aggregates and therefore not accessible for microorganisms. DOM biodegradation is defined as the utilisation of organic compounds by soil microorganisms quantified by the disappearance of DOM or O2 or by the evolution of CO2. The controlling factors for DOM biodegradability can be divided into three groups, namely, intrinsic DOM quality parameters, soil and solution parameters and external factors. DOM characteristics that generally enhance its biodegradability are high contents of carbohydrates, organic acids and proteins for which the hydrophilic neutral fraction seems to be a good estimate. In contrast, aromatic and hydrophobic structures that can also be assessed by UV absorbance decrease DOM biodegradability, either due to their recalcitrance or due to inhibiting effects on enzyme activity. Effects of solution parameters such as Al, Fe, Ca and heavy metal concentrations on DOM biodegradability have been documented in various studies, however with different, sometimes conflicting results. Inhibitory effects of metals are generally attributed to toxicity of the organic complexes or the free metal ions. In contrast, the enhanced degradability observed in the presence of metal ions may be due to flocculation, as larger structures will provide better attachment for microbial colonies. As degradation is dependent on microbial activity, the composition and density of the microbial population used in the degradation studies also influence biodegradation. Site-specific factors, such as vegetation, land use and seasonality of meteorological parameters control DOM composition and soil and soil solution properties and therefore also affect its biodegradability. The major obstacle for a better understanding of the controls of DOM biodegradability is the lack of a standardised methodology or at least systematic comparisons between the large number of methods used to assess DOM biodegradability.

TI  - N2O and CH4 emissions from soils under conventional and no-till management practices in Goiânia (Cerrados, Brazil)
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are important greenhouse gases (GHG) produced respectively by the naturally occurring microbial processes of incomplete denitrification or nitrification and methanogenesis. Tillage practices and climate affect the release of GHGs. No tillage (DMC) systems may increase CO2–C fixation in soil but also N2O and CH4 emissions. The aim of this article is to question whether the positive effect of a DMC system observed on carbon storage for the topsoil layer in Cerrado soils is offset or not by the N2O and/or CH4 emissions. Two 5-year-old systems, tillage (disc on the first 15 cm called offset: OFF) and a direct-sowing mulch-based crop system (DMC) with an additional cover crop were studied during a cropping cycle. N2O and CH4 fluxes are determined using a closed-chamber, N2O and CO2 concentrations are measured at 3 depths (10-, 20- and 30 cm). No significant difference between treatments was observed for both gases (for emissions and concentrations). Soil N2O contents increase from surface to depth (30 cm) and range from 300 ppbv to 3 ppm for both treatments. Total annual estimated emissions of N2O range from 31 to 35 g N2O–N ha− 1 year− 1 for DMC and OFF respectively which is low and corresponds only to 0.03% of the total N-fertilizer applied. Monthly means N2O emissions were strongly correlated to monthly means of N2O content at 10 cm depth (R2 = 0.66) and seem to increase exponentially with monthly mean Water Filled Pore Space WFPS (0–10 cm layer) (R2 = 0.33). CH4 fluxes were very low as well: both treatment act as source of CH4 (245 and 403 g CH4–C ha− 1 year− 1 for DMC and OFF respectively. On a CO2–C equivalent basis these results correspond to 4.1 and 4.7 kg CO2–C ha− 1 year− 1 for N2O and to 1.9 and 3.1 kg CO2–C ha− 1 year− 1 for CH4 for DMC and OFF respectively. As a result, the carbon sequestration balance taking into account the CO2, CH4 and N2O on a CO2–C equivalent basis is in favour of DMC treatment considering that this treatment increases carbon storage originated from CO2–C for the topsoil (0–10 cm) layer (350 kg C ha− 1 year− 1) in comparison with OFF treatment.

TI  - Relationship of soil organic matter dynamics to physical protection and tillage
PY  - 2000
AB  - Tillage has been reported to reduce organic matter concentrations and increase organic matter turnover rates to a variable extent. The change of soil climate and the incorporation of aboveground C inputs within the soil lead to no unique effect on biodegradation rates, because of their strong interaction with the regional climate and the soil physical properties. The periodical perturbation of soil structure by tools and the subsequent drying‐rewetting cycles may be the major factor increasing organic matter decomposition rates by exposing the organic matter that is physically protected in microaggregates to biodegradation. This paper reviews the assessed effects of tillage on organic matter, the scale, extent and mechanisms of physical protection of organic matter in soils. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Effects of feeding fresh white clover (Trifolium repens) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) on enteric methane emissions from sheep
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Enteric CH4 contributes about one third of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions. Measurements from our laboratory using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) technique suggested much lower CH4 yields (as g CH4/kg dry matter (DM) intake) from sheep fed fresh white clover (Trifolium repens) compared with fresh perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Thus, white clover offers an opportunity to reduce CH4 emissions from pastoral based ruminant livestock systems if its lower CH4 yield can be confirmed using respiration chambers. This study was comprised of 2 experiments where good nutritional quality freshly harvested white clover and perennial ryegrass were fed to 16 sheep in Experiment 1 (8/diet) and 32 sheep in Experiment 2 (16/diet). Intakes were about 1.6 times metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance (×MEm) in Experiment 1 and 0.8 × MEm and 2.0 × MEm in Experiment 2 (8/diet/feeding level). In both experiments sheep had a 10 d acclimatization to their diets and CH4 emissions were measured in respiration chambers for 2 consecutive days. Methane yield (g CH4/kg DM intake) was 12% lower (P=0.04) for white clover (19.8) compared with ryegrass fed sheep (22.5) in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, there were no effects of forage on CH4 yield (as g CH4/kg DM intake) at 0.8 × MEm (27.1 and 25.5, respectively) but, at 2.0 × MEm, CH4 yield (as g CH4/kg DM intake) was 7% higher (P=0.05) for white clover (23.4) compared with ryegrass (21.7). Analyses of combined data from both experiments show that there were no overall dietary effects on CH4 yield, but increased intakes reduced CH4 yield (P This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture – Finding a Balance Between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

TI  - The adoption of non-inversion tillage systems in the United Kingdom and the agronomic impact on soil, crops and the environment—A review
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper seeks to review the current knowledge on soil cultivation and its effects to both soil physical properties and consideration to soil management to optimise crop productivity and yield when using non-inversion tillage within the United Kingdom (UK). There are many terms used to describe conservation tillage, more commonly referred to within the UK as non-inversion tillage, but it has generally been defined as any tillage system that maintains at least 30% residue cover on the soil surface after drilling to reduce the risk of soil erosion, conserve soil organic matter and improve soil structural stability. Consideration to a number of important factors needs to be given if successful adoption of non-inversion tillage is to be made in the UK. Soil type can have a substantial influence on the relative success of the adoption of non-inversion tillage. For example, on self-structuring clay soils the system can be relatively well suited and allow for timely cultivations that reduces the risk for creating very dry, cloddy seedbeds following ploughing wet soil that are difficult for establishing a successful crop. However, in contrast some unstructured light sand soils tend not to be suitable for non-inversion tillage because the soil aggregates tend to form an angular structure that fit tightly together excluding the movement of air and water through the soil profile that are fundamental requirements for healthy crop growth. Further agronomic management factors including crop residue handling at harvest and the consideration to weed control strategies that seek to reduce the risk to increasing herbicide resistance, in particular grass weeds, from the use of selective herbicide groups, e.g. sulfonylurea herbicides (e.g. Atlantis). If these factors are carefully managed then the opportunities in reducing fuel use, timeliness of cultivations and improved soil erosion control that non-inversion tillage can offer are potentially of great value in adopting sustainable cultivation strategies for maintaining or improving crop performance in a period of increased economic and environmental uncertainty.

TI  - Dry matter production and nutrient accumulation after successive crops of lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogongrass in a substrate with zeolite
PY  - 2010
AB  - SUMMARY Zeolites are hydrated crystalline aluminosilicate minerals of natural occurrence, structured in rigid third dimension net that can be used as slow release plant-nutrient source. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of plant growth substrate under zeolite application, enriched with N, P and K, on dry matter yield and on nutrient contents in consecutive crops of lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogon grass. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, with 3 kg pots with an inert substrate, evaluated in a randomized block design with three replications. Treatments consisted of four types of enrichment of concentrated natural zeolite: concentrated zeolite (Z) only, zeolite + KNO3 (ZNK), zeolite + K2HPO4 (ZPK) and zeolite + H3PO4 + apatite (ZP), and a control grown in substrate fertilized with a zeolite-free nutrient solution. Four levels of enriched zeolite were tested: 20, 40, 80, and 160 g/pot. Four successive crops were grown on the same substrate in each pot: lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogon grass. Results indicated that N, P and K enriched zeolite was an adequate slow-release nutrient source for plants. The total dry matter production of above-ground biomass of four successive crops followed a descending order: ZP > ZPK > ZNK > Z.

TI  - Effects of Tillage, Crop Rotation, and Nitrogen Fertilization on Wheat under Rainfed Mediterranean Conditions
PY  - 2000
AB  - The combined long-term effects of tillage method, crop rotation, and N fertilizer rates on grain yield have not been studied in rainfed systems under Mediterranean climates. As part of a long-term experiment started in 1986, a field study was conducted between 1994 and 1998 to determine the effects of tillage (TILL), crop rotation (ROT), and N fertilization on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth and yield in a rainfed Mediterranean region. Tillage treatments included no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). Crop rotations were wheat-sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (WS), wheat-chickpea (Cicerarietinum L.) (WCP), wheat-faba bean (Vicia faba L.) (WFB), wheatfallow (WF), and continuous wheat (CW). Nitrogen fertilizer rates were 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha -1 on a Vertisol (Typic Haploxerert). A split-split plot design with four replications was used. Heavy rainfall during this research negatively impacted vegetative growth and grain yield of the wheat due to waterlogging. Wheat yield in the wet years was lower under NT than under CT. Yield decreased in the following crop rotation sequence: WFB » WF > WS > WCP » CW. Wheat responded to N fertilizer at rates up to 100 kg N ha -1 in the wet years but exhibited no response in the dry years. Yield under CT was higher at all N rate applied to wheat. The effect of N fertilizer on yield was more marked for the rotations with no legumes. The incorporation of the results for the 4-yr period to those of the long-term experiment provides more consistent information on the characterization and performance of the various systems.

TI  - A synthesis of carbon sequestration, carbon emissions, and net carbon flux in agriculture: comparing tillage practices in the United States
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract The atmospheric CO 2 concentration is increasing, due primarily to fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. Sequestering atmospheric C in agricultural soils is being advocated as a possibility to partially offset fossil-fuel emissions. Sequestering C in agriculture requires a change in management practices, i.e. efficient use of pesticides, irrigation, and farm machinery. The C emissions associated with a change in practices have not traditionally been incorporated comprehensively into C sequestration analyses. A full C cycle analysis has been completed for agricultural inputs, resulting in estimates of net C flux for three crop types across three tillage intensities. The full C cycle analysis includes estimates of energy use and C emissions for primary fuels, electricity, fertilizers, lime, pesticides, irrigation, seed production, and farm machinery. Total C emissions values were used in conjunction with C sequestration estimates to model net C flux to the atmosphere over time. Based on US average crop inputs, no-till emitted less CO 2 from agricultural operations than did conventional tillage, with 137 and 168 kg C ha −1 per year, respectively. Changing from conventional tillage to no-till is therefore estimated to both enhance C sequestration and decrease CO 2 emissions. While the enhanced C sequestration will continue for a finite time, the reduction in net CO 2 flux to the atmosphere, caused by the reduced fossil-fuel use, can continue indefinitely, as long as the alternative practice is continued. Estimates of net C flux, which are based on US average inputs, will vary across crop type and different climate regimes. The C coefficients calculated for agricultural inputs can be used to estimate C emissions and net C flux on a site-specific basis.

TI  - Simulation of fluxes of greenhouse gases from European grasslands using the DNDC model
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural management of grasslands results in sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs, particularly CO2, N2O and CH4). Here, we used a process-based model (DNDC) to estimate the fluxes of the major GHGs from grasslands at 0.5° resolution across Europe, and combined these to produce a spatially explicit estimate of the total global warming potential (GWP, expressed in CO2 equivalents). The DNDC model [Li, C., Frolking, S., Crocker, G.J., Grace, P.R., Klir, J., Korchens, M., Poulton, P.R., 1997. Simulating trends in soil organic carbon in long-term experiments using the DNDC model. Geoderma 81, 45–60] simulates carbon and nitrogen cycling in agro-ecosystems at a sub-daily time step and consists of four interacting submodels: soil and climate (including water flow and leaching), plant growth, decomposition, and denitrification. Input data sets for grassland area, climate, nitrogen deposition, and soil properties were collated. The typical current grassland management regime was established for ten biogeographical regions on the basis of questionnaires sent to national experts, and used to derive model input data. A 20-year simulation was carried out using DNDC for each site. Simple estimates of methane emissions from grazing livestock were made according to the IPCC Tier 1 method. Most grassland areas are net sources for GHGs in terms of total global warming potential—the beneficial effect of sequestering carbon in soil is outweighed by the emissions of N2O from soil and (predominantly) CH4 emissions from livestock. The net effect of European grasslands on GWP (emission of 23 Tg C year−1) corresponds to a 2.5% increase on the EU-15 fossil fuel CO2 emissions (907 Tg C year−1).

TI  - Conservation agriculture : what is it and why is it important for future sustainable food production?
PY  - 2007
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance (no-till) and permanent soil cover (mulch) combined with rotations, is a more sustainable cultivation system for the future than those presently practised. The present paper first introduces the reasons for tillage in agriculture and discusses how this age-old agricultural practice is responsible for the degradation of natural resources and soils. The paper goes on to introduce conservation tillage (CT), a minimum tillage and surface mulch practice that was developed in response to the severe wind erosion caused by mouldboard tillage of grasslands and referred to as the American dust bowl of the 1930s. CT is then compared with CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where no-till, mulch, and rotations significantly improve soil properties (physical, biological, and chemical) and other biotic factors, enabling more efficient use of natural resources. CA can improve agriculture through improvement in water infiltration and reducing erosion, improving soil surface aggregates, reducing compaction through promotion of biological tillage, increasing surface soil organic matter and carbon content, moderating soil temperatures, and suppressing weeds. CA also helps reduce costs of production, saves time, increases yield through more timely planting, reduces diseases and pests through stimulation of biological diversity, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Availability of suitable equipment is a major constraint to successful CA, but advances in design and manufacture of seed drills by local manufacturers are enabling farmers to experiment and accept this technology in many parts of the world. Estimates of farmer adoption of CA are close to 100 million ha in 2005, indicating that farmers are convinced of the benefits of this technology. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to produce more food, sustainably, from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands. This will be a significant challenge for agricultural scientists, extension personnel, and farmers. Promoting and adopting CA management systems can help meet this complex goal.

TI  - Carbon input differences as the main factor explaining the variability in soil organic C storage in no-tilled compared to inversion tilled agrosystems
PY  - 2011
AB  - WOS:000300659300002International audienceConversion to no-till (NT) is usually associated to increased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in comparison to inversion tillage (IT). However, an important and unexplained variability in the changes in SOC with NT adoption exists, which impedes accurate prediction of its potential for C sequestration. We performed a meta-analysis with pedo-climatic and crop factors observed to influence SOC storage under NT at local and regional scales, in order to determine those better explaining this variability at a global scale. We studied SOC stocks (0-30 cm) in an equivalent soil mass, climatic and soil characteristics in 92 NT-IT paired cases. A sub-base with the 35 pairs providing C inputs was used to test their effect. Greater SOC stocks were observed with NT, with a smaller difference than often described (6.7%, i.e. 3.4 Mg C ha(-1)). Crop C inputs differences was the only factor significantly and positively related to SOC stock differences between NT and IT, explaining 30% of their variability. The variability in SOC storage induced by NT conversion seems largely related to the variability of the crop production response. Changes at the agro-ecosystem level, not only in soil, should be considered when assessing the potential of NT for C sequestration

TI  - Nitrogen oxide emissions affected by organic fertilization in a non-irrigated Mediterranean barley field
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Contradictory findings can be found in the literature regarding the effects of applying organic instead of mineral fertilizers on the associated emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO). The main aim of this experiment was to study the effect on these emissions of applying mineral or organic fertilizers to a non-irrigated crop under Mediterranean conditions. A secondary aim was to determine whether application of the fertilizer had a residual effect on the N2O and NO pulses observed after the first rainfall events in autumn, and the magnitude of these fluxes. A field experiment was carried out with a barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Bornova). Untreated pig slurry (UPS), digested pig slurry (DPS), municipal solid waste (MSW) and composted crop residues mixed with sewage sludge (CCR + S) were applied to the soil. The resulting emissions were compared with those from a mineral fertilizer, urea (U), and a control treatment (C), in which no nitrogen was applied. Very low NO and N2O fluxes were measured during the entire experimental period in all treatments. The accumulated N2O emissions from the organic and inorganic fertilizers ranged from 266 to 345 g N2O-N ha−1 and did not show significant differences. Three of the four organic fertilizers had the positive effect of reducing NO emissions (28.82–44.48 g NO-N ha−1) compared with inorganic fertilizer (61.86 g NO-N ha−1). Nitrous oxide pulses were observed in autumn. Negative N2O fluxes were measured on several occasions. The emission factor relating N2O emissions to the N applied as fertilizer, ranged from 0.06 to 0.17% for MSW and DPS, respectively, which is much lower than the default factor proposed by the IPCC. The emission factor which relates N2O emissions to crop production ranged from 241 to 361 mg N2O-N kg−1 for DPS and U, respectively, suggesting that DPS should be promoted in order to reduce N2O emissions.

TI  - Effects of residue management and controlled traffic on carbon dioxide and water loss
PY  - 1999
AB  - Management of crop residues and soil organic matter is of primary importance in maintaining soil fertility and productivity and in minimizing agricultural impact on the environment. Our objective was to determine the effects of traffic and tillage on short-term carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) fluxes from a representative soil in the southeastern Coastal Plain (USA). The study was conducted on a Norfolk loamy sand (FAO classification, Luxic Ferralsols; USDA classification, fine-loamy siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudults) cropped to a corn (Zea mays L.) — soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) rotation with a crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) winter cover crop for eight years. Experimental variables were with and without traffic under conventional tillage (CT) (disk harrow twice, chisel plow, field cultivator) and no tillage (NT) arranged in a splitplot design with four replicates. A wide-frame tractive vehicle enabled tillage without wheel traffic. Short-term CO2 and H2O fluxes were measured with a large portable chamber. Gas exchange measurements were made on both CT and NT at various times associated with tillage and irrigation events. Tillage-induced CO2 and H2O fluxes were larger than corresponding fluxes from untilled soil. Irrigation caused the CO2 fluxes to increase rapidly from both tillage systems, suggesting that soil gas fluxes were initially limited by lack of water. Tillage-induced CO2 and H2O fluxes were consistently higher than under NT. Cumulative CO2 flux from CT at the end of 80 h was nearly three times larger than from NT while the corresponding H2O loss was 1.6 times larger. Traffic had no significant effects on the magnitude of CO2 fluxes, possibly reflecting this soil’s natural tendency to reconsolidate. The immediate impact of intensive surface tillage of sandy soils on gaseous carbon loss was larger than traffic effects and suggests a need to develop new management practices for enhanced soil carbon and water management for these sensitive soils. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - N2O emission from soil following combined application of fertiliser-N and ground weed residues
PY  - 2007
AB  - Emissions of N2O and CO2 were measured following combined applications of 15N-labelled fertiliser (100 μg N g−1; 10 atom % excess 15N) and organic olive crop weed residues (Avena sativa, Ononis viscosa, Ridolfia segetum and Olea europea; 100 μg N g−1) to a silt loam soil under controlled environment conditions. The objective was to determine the effect of varying combinations of inorganic fertiliser and plant residues on these emissions and soil mineral N dynamics. Emissions were generally increased following application of residues alone, with 23 ng N2O–N g−1 soil (2 ng N2O–N g−1 soil mg−1 biomass) and 389 μg CO2–C g−1 soil (39 μg CO2–C g−1 soil mg−1 biomass) emitted over 28 days after addition of the Ridolfia residues in the absence of fertiliser-N. N2O emissions from these residue-only treatments were strongly negatively correlated with residue lignin content (r = −0.91; P < 0.05), total carbon content (r = −0.90; P < 0.05) and (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N ratio (r = −0.70; P < 0.1). However, changes in the net input of these compounds through application of 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 proportional mixtures of Avena and Ononis residues had no effect on emissions compared to their single (0:100 or 100:0) applications. Addition of fertiliser-N increased emissions (by up to 30 ng N2O–N g−1 28 days−1; 123%), particularly from the low residue-N treatments (Avena and Ridolfia) where a greater quantity of biomass was applied, resulting in emissions above that of the sum from the unfertilised residue and fertilised control treatments. In contrast, fertiliser application had no impact on emissions from the Olea treatment with the highest polyphenol (2%) and lignin (11%) contents due to strong immobilisation of soil N, and the 15N–N2O data indicated that residue quality had no effect on the denitrification of applied fertiliser-N. Such apparent inconsistencies mean that before the potential for manipulating N input (organic + inorganic) to lower gaseous N losses can be realised, first the nature and extent of interactions between the different N sources and any interactions with other compounds released from the residues need to be better understood.

TI  - Evaluation of sewage sludge as a soil amendment in relation to nitrate leaching.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nitrate leaching may be a major problem in certain soils after intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers. Moderate use of organic amendments, i.e. sewage sludge, can supply available N and reduce the accelerating use of conventional fertilizers, which may lead to slower nitrate leaching. The aim of this study was to examine nitrate mobility in Mediterranean soils of low organic matter content using soil leaching columns amended with sewage sludge and inorganic fertilizer. Eight soil samples from the Gulf of Kalloni, Lesvos Island, which typically bear the above mentioned characteristics, were used. It was found that sludge application at 10 t ha -1 increased nitrate retention capacity of soils either by rendering a smaller amount of nitrates available to leaching or by reducing the rate of NO 3- N release. Average NO 3- N leaching was 0.016 in control, 0.092 in sludge treatment, and 0.130 in fertilizer treatment (units in mg N kg -1 soil mm -1 eluted water). After about 100 mm of added water, cumulative leaching of NO 3- N reached a plateau in most soils, but nitrate recovery was a fraction of the added, probably due to denitrification- and immobilization- related N losses.

TI  - Pruning Residues as an Alternative to Traditional Tillage to Reduce Erosion and Pollutant Dispersion in Olive Groves
PY  - 2008
AB  - During the seasons 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06, a study was made of the evolution of runoff as well as soil and available P and K losses in the sediment carried away in a conventional till system—that most used at the present time—and in a no till system with added pruning remains in an olive grove of the picual variety located in Torredonjimeno (Jaen, Spain). A group of microplots for sediment collection in a randomized complete block design was established. The samples were collected in the field after each storm. In the study period, a total of 21 storms were recorded, with a precipitation of 450 mm in 2003/04, 179 mm in 2004/05 and 388 mm in 2005/06. The erosivity of the rainfall was characterized and the cover percentage in the plots throughout the time was determined. The establishment of pruning remains reduced soil loss with respect to conventional tillage (CT) in the 3 years (72%). Likewise, the available P loss greatly declined in the study (46.4%) under conservation agriculture. The reduction in available K loss (72.4%) was much greater than that of available P. The close relationship between both variables and sediment production also stands out. Runoff was the parameter on which the pruning remains had the least influence with only an 11% average reduction.

TI  - A review of tillage effects on crop residue management, seedbed conditions and seedling establishment
PY  - 2001
AB  - There is considerable discussion about the influence of soil management techniques on soil erosion, water use and conservation, and more recently carbon dioxide sequestration and waste disposal. The soil–atmosphere interface, particularly the seed bed layer is of particular concern to agronomists and soil scientists because it is the focus of the physical processes affecting crop establishment and biological activity. This paper evaluates the current knowledge (1) in modeling seedling emergence and residue decomposition, (2) seedbed structure and its resulting physical conditions, and (3) tillage operations affect on seedbed structure and residue distribution.

TI  - The response of sugar beet to drip and low-pressure sprinkler irrigation in southern Italy
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Scarce water resources frequently limit crop production in semi-arid lands. Drip irrigation may constitute a method for sagacious management of water resources, but there is still limited information on its use for sugar beet crop in Mediterranean environments. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of irrigation on sucrose accumulation and root yield, as well as on sugar beet physiological responses, and to compare drip and low-pressure sprinkler (high efficiency) irrigation performances for sugar quality. As the main scope of the study was to give indications to allow water saving, the comparison focused on the best irrigation method when a similar amount of water was applied. Sugar beets were grown in an experimental field site in southern Italy (Molise Region) for two consecutive growing seasons (1999/2000 and 2000/2001). The water applied ranged from 50, 75, and 100% of the estimated evapotranspiration (ET); unirrigated sugar beets were taken as control plants. In both years, harvest was completed in two periods. Increasing volume of water replaced was advantageous for crop performances, and yield and physiological responses of sugar beets drip irrigated with 75% of estimated ET matched in most cases those of low-pressure sprinkler irrigated with 100% of estimated ET, resulting in potential 25% of water volume saving. In general, drip irrigation influenced positively many of the considered physiological and technological parameters, as compared to low-pressure sprinkler irrigation. Differences in root production and sugar quality between the two harvest periods were not significant. Results indicate that (1) increasing the amount of water applied gives benefits in terms of sugar beet root yield and sucrose accumulation, (2) drip irrigation (even applied every-other-furrow) appears to be consistently advantageous with respect to low-pressure sprinkler irrigation for sugar beet performances in semi-arid environments, (3) there are indications that suggest sugar beet growers should harvest in advance (of traditional harvest dates).

TI  - Determinants of annual fluxes of CO2 and N2O in long-term no-tillage and conventional tillage systems in northern France
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract The greenhouse gases CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were quantified in a long-term experiment in northern France, in which no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) had been differentiated during 32 years in plots under a maize–wheat rotation. Continuous CO 2 and periodical N 2 O soil emission measurements were performed during two periods: under maize cultivation (April 2003–July 2003) and during the fallow period after wheat harvest (August 2003–March 2004). In order to document the dynamics and importance of these emissions, soil organic C and mineral N, residue decomposition, soil potential for CO 2 emission and climatic data were measured. CO 2 emissions were significantly larger in NT on 53% and in CT on 6% of the days. From April to July 2003 and from November 2003 to March 2004, the cumulated CO 2 emissions did not differ significantly between CT and NT. However, the cumulated CO 2 emissions from August to November 2003 were considerably larger for NT than for CT. Over the entire 331 days of measurement, CT and NT emitted 3160 ± 269 and 4064 ± 138 kg CO 2 -C ha −1 , respectively. The differences in CO 2 emissions in the two tillage systems resulted from the soil climatic conditions and the amounts and location of crop residues and SOM. A large proportion of the CO 2 emissions in NT over the entire measurement period was probably due to the decomposition of old weathered residues. NT tended to emit more N 2 O than CT over the entire measurement period. However differences were statistically significant in only half of the cases due to important variability. N 2 O emissions were generally less than 5 g N ha −1  day −1 , except for a few dates where emission increased up to 21 g N ha −1  day −1 . These N 2 O fluxes represented 0.80 ± 0.15 and 1.32 ± 0.52 kg N 2 O-N ha −1  year −1 for CT and NT, respectively. Depending on the periods, a large part of the N 2 O emissions occurred was probably induced by nitrification, since soil conditions were not favorable for denitrification. Finally, for the period of measurement after 32 years of tillage treatments, the NT system emitted more greenhouses gases (CO 2 and N 2 O) to the atmosphere on an annual basis than the CT system.

TI  - Dissolved organic nitrogen in contrasting agricultural ecosystems
PY  - 2005
AB  - Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is increasingly being recognized as a major component of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, however, the factors that regulate its behaviour in soil remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of agricultural land use on the amount of DON in soil. At 94 sites, representing seven contrasting agricultural land use types, we extracted soil solution during the growing season. DON was high in all land use types constituting 57±8% of the total dissolved N (TDN) pool and generally followed the series

citrus>vegetable>forest=arable>grassland=wetland>heathland.citrus>vegetable>forest=arable>grassland=wetland>heathland.



The TDN pool was dominated by DON in less intensive agricultural systems. In relative contrast to DON, the amount of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) varied widely upon land use with intensive agricultural systems being dominated by NO3− and low input systems dominated by NH4+. We conclude that DON represents a significant N pool in all agroecosystems but its concentration is less sensitive to land use system than DIN.

TI  - Carbon input differences as the main factor explaining the variability in soil organic C storage in no-tilled compared to inversion tilled agrosystems
PY  - 2011
AB  - Conversion to no-till (NT) is usually associated to increased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in comparison to inversion tillage (IT). However, an important and unexplained variability in the changes in SOC with NT adoption exists, which impedes accurate prediction of its potential for C sequestration. We performed a meta-analysis with pedo-climatic and crop factors observed to influence SOC storage under NT at local and regional scales, in order to determine those better explaining this variability at a global scale. We studied SOC stocks (0–30 cm) in an equivalent soil mass, climatic and soil characteristics in 92 NT–IT paired cases. A sub-base with the 35 pairs providing C inputs was used to test their effect. Greater SOC stocks were observed with NT, with a smaller difference than often described (6.7%, i.e. 3.4 Mg C ha−1). Crop C inputs differences was the only factor significantly and positively related to SOC stock differences between NT and IT, explaining 30% of their variability. The variability in SOC storage induced by NT conversion seems largely related to the variability of the crop production response. Changes at the agro-ecosystem level, not only in soil, should be considered when assessing the potential of NT for C sequestration.

TI  - Quantitative digestion of fresh herbage by sheep
PY  - 1980
AB  - The utilization by sheep of dietary N provided in high protein, high water content fresh herbages (Ruanui perennial ryegrass, Tama Westerwolds ryegrass, Pitau white clover, and Fakir giant sainfoin at two stages of maturity) was studied at two levels of intake (maintenance and 1·5 maintenance). Feed was provided by constant feeder. Apparent digestibility of N was similar for all herbages ( ca . 85%) except sainfoin which, particularly at a late stage of maturity, was lower (70–80%). A small loss of nitrogen across the stomachs occurred with clover (1–3 g/day) and Tama ryegrass at the higher feeding level (2 g/day), but no loss was observed with the other diets. The apparent digestibility of N and of non-ammonia N (NAN) in the intestines was lower for sainfoin, and estimated true digestibility was also lower. Amino acid N contributed less to the NAN reaching the duodenum on the sainfoin diets than on the grass and clover diets. N retention was negative at the lower level of feeding for ryegrass and clover diets. It was greatest for the sainfoin diets at similar N intakes, so that efficiency of retention of apparently digested N was also greatest for sainfoin. The size of the urea pool, the plasma urea concentration and the urea irreversible loss, using [ 14 C]urea, did not differ significantly between diets at similar N intake. Urea irreversible loss exceeded urinary urea excretion by 35—50% on all but the late-maturity sainfoin diet, where urea irreversible loss was more than double the urinary urea output. These data indicate dietary differences in the extent of degradation of urea on recycling to the gastro-intestinal tract. Urea clearance across the kidney was also lowest for sainfoin. Data are compared in a simple model which illustrates the importance of variable clearance of urea across the kidney and the gut wall and the need for knowledge of factors which control this.

TI  - The impact of soil management on aggregation, carbon stabilization and carbon loss as CO2 in the surface layer of a Rhodic Ferralsol in Southern Brazil.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Soil aggregation and organic carbon accumulation are two intrinsically linked phenomena. Soils under natural vegetation and conservation tillage systems generally have higher aggregation indices and total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in the surface layers than soils under conventional management (ploughing). From the point of view of the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), C stabilization and loss in the surface layer is relevant. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on TOC stabilization and loss through soil aggregation in the topsoil. Soil aggregation, TOC stocks, and fluxes of CO2 of samples from a Rhodic Ferralsol under NT and CT in a long-term field experiment in Southern Brazil were measured. A natural forest site was also evaluated as reference to the management sites. Emissions of CO2 were measured in laboratory incubation experiment on bulk soil samples and on soil aggregate size fractions, previously separated by dry sieving, in intact and destroyed (crushed to <0.250 mm) state. The soil under NT had larger aggregates and larger proportion of the soil in greater aggregate size classes than CT. Total organic carbon stocks were higher under NT both in bulk soil samples and macroaggregates than under CT. Under laboratory conditions the bulk soil samples from NT showed higher emission rates of CO2 (CO2BS = 18.3 kg C ha−1 h−1) than from CT (CO2BS = 2.3 kg C ha−1 h−1) due to the overall higher TOC stocks. The TOC that was lost by CO2 emission due to the oxidation of readily decomposable macroaggregate-protected SOM in NT (ΣΔCO2 = 79.4 kg C ha−1 h−1) was, however, also higher than under CT (CT: ΣΔCO2 = 29.1 kg C ha−1 h−1). The TOC stabilized by macroaggregation in NT was also more than the TOC lost by CO2 emission from the bulk soil (ΣΔCO2-CO2BS = 61.1 kg C ha−1 h−1), and the difference between these two was higher under NT than under CT (ΣΔCO2-CO2BS = 26.8 kg C ha−1 h−1), showing that NT in fact accumulates more TOC in the soil by protecting it within the macroaggregates. The natural forest had higher TOC stock and emission rates than the tilled soils, however it also stabilized more TOC. Thus, no-tillage in its effect on carbon stabilization, is between the natural ecosystem and CT, representing a soil management system that seems to be an efficient on the way path to the recuperation of soil after conventional management systems.

TI  - Effect of different N fertilisation strategies on yield, plant N status, N uptake and soil characteristics in a maize-barley rotation
PY  - 2007
AB  - - A field experiment was carried out to determine the effect of different strategies of N fertilisation on the maize-winter barley rotation. Five N managements were applied on a catch-crop of maize: mineral N, at 200 and 100 kg N ha '; olive pomace compost plus mineral N (100 + 100 kg N ha -1 ); olive pomace compost at 100 kg N ha -1 ; unfertilised control. The residual effects of the N treatments were evaluated in the following unfertilised winter barley crop. The results show that it is possible to achieve good yields and high protein content and N uptake in both maize and barley crops when N fertiliser is partially substituted with an organic amendment, whereas the application of the organic waste as the only source of N is unsustainable from the agronomic point of view. Furthermore, the total organic carbon in the soil at the end of experiment increased with the application of organic N. At last, the N indicators (SPAD readings and nitrate concentration) allow us to obtain indications about the plant N status, providing useful information for the eventual adjustment of N fertilisation during plant cycles.

TI  - Denitrification in a vertisol under long-term tillage and no-tillage management in dryland agricultural systems: Key genes and potential rates
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract The impact of tillage practices on microbial N transformations in Vertisols is poorly understood and data from long-term field experiments are scarce, particularly in semiarid regions. We evaluated the effects of traditional tillage (TT) vs no-tillage (NT) on denitrification in a long-term field experiment under a rainfed crop rotation system (cereal-sunflower-legumes) on a Vertisol (SW Spain). In general, the abundance of denitrifiers and the respective potential denitrification rates was higher under NT compared to TT during the vegetation period, but not after harvesting. However differences in denitrifier numbers were within the same order of magnitude (0.5–3 × 107 copies g soil dw). The abundance of nitrite reducers and N2O reducers was relatively similar. In addition, N2O/N2 ratios between 1 and 2 were found for both treatments. These results emphasize that NT has a limited impact on denitrification in Vertisols under fertilizer regime and legume-crop rotation and thus losses of N2O are expected to be comparable to those of traditional tillage systems.

TI  - Crop residue removal and fertilizer N: Effects on soil organic carbon in a long-term crop rotation experiment on a Udic Boroll
PY  - 2009
AB  - Biofuels can be produced by converting cellulose in crop residues to ethanol. This has recently been viewed as a potential supplement to non-renewable energy sources, especially in the Americas. A 50-yr field experiment was analyzed to determine the influence of (i) removing approximately 22% of the above-ground wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residue each crop year, and (ii) N and P fertilization on soil carbon (C) in the top 15 cm depth of a fallow–wheat–wheat (F–W–W) rotation. The study was conducted from 1958 to 2007 on a clay soil, at Indian Head in sub-humid southeast Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil C concentrations and bulk densities were measured in the 0–7.5 and 7.5–15 cm depths in 1987, 1996 and 2007 and soil C changes were related to C inputs estimated from straw and root yields calculated from regressions relating these to grain yields. Two soil organic matter models [the Campbell model and the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM)] were also used to simulate and predict the effects of the treatments on soil C change over time, and to estimate likely soil C change if 50% or 95% of above-ground residues were harvested each crop year. Crop residue removal reduced cumulative C inputs from straw and roots over the 50-yr experiment by only 13%, and this did not significantly (P > 0.05) reduce soil C throughout the experiment duration. However, after 50 yr of applying N fertilizer at recommended rates, soil C increased significantly by about 3 Mg ha−1 compared to the non-fertilized treatment. The simulated effect of removing 50% and 95% of the above-ground residues suggested that removing 50% of the straw would likely have a detectable effect on the soil C, while removing 95% of the straw certainly would. Measurements and model simulations suggest that adoption of no-tillage without proper fertilization will not increase soil C. Although it appears that a modest amount of residue may be safely removed from these Udic Borolls (Black Chernozems) without a measurable effect on soil C, this would only be feasible if accompanied by appropriate fertility management.

TI  - Alternative temperate forages containing secondary compounds for improving sustainable productivity in grazing ruminants
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract The use of alternative temperate forages to improve the sustainable productivity of grazing ruminants, relative to grass-based pastures, is reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed upon forages containing secondary compounds for sustainable control of internal parasites, for increasing reproductive rate in sheep, reducing bloat risk in cattle and for reducing methane production as a means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Of the forages reviewed, the herb chicory ( Chicorium intybus ) and the condensed tannin-containing legumes Lotus corniculatus L. and sulla ( Hedysarum coronarium ) offered the most advantages. Chicory and sulla promoted faster growth rates in young sheep and deer in the presence of internal parasites, and showed reduced methane production in other studies. L. corniculatus was not as effective as chicory and sulla in promoting growth of lambs in the presence of internal parasites. Grazing on L. corniculatus was associated with increases in reproductive rate in sheep, increases in milk production in both ewes and dairy cows and reduced methane production, effects that were mainly due to its content of condensed tannins (CT). Grazing ewes on L. corniculatus during mating and very early pregnancy may also reduce lamb mortality. However, there are no data on the effect of mating ewes, which are grazing chicory on their reproductive performance, an important omission. Risk of rumen frothy bloat in cattle grazing legumes is reduced when the forage contains 5 g CT/kg dry matter (DM) or greater. Gene transfer techniques aimed at achieving this for lucerne ( Medicago sativa ) have made progress, but CT concentration needs to be further increased from calculated values of 0.75–1.25 g CT/kg DM in the transformed plants. Bloat control may be achievable in genetically transformed legumes before increased amino acid absorption, as the concentration of CT required for bloat control is lower (5 versus 30–40 g/kg DM) than that required to cause increased amino acid absorption and is not affected by differences in CT structure. Key plant characteristics for improved sustainable productivity are a high ratio of readily fermentable: structural carbohydrate and the presence of CT and certain other secondary compounds. Taking into account both nutritional and agronomic considerations, chicory is considered one of the best emerging plants for grazing livestock, with L. corniculatus being more suitable for areas with dry summers and warm winters. Some of the agronomic limitations of L. corniculatus and sulla could be reduced by mechanical harvesting and their inclusion as a component in total mixed rations (TMR), instead of grazing.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from an irrigated soil as affected by fertilizer and straw management
PY  - 2001
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from farmland is a concern for both environmental quality and agricultural productivity. Field experiments were conducted in 1996–1997 to assess soil N2O emissions as affected by timing of N fertilizer application and straw/tillage practices for crop production under irrigation in southern Alberta. The crops were soft wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) in 1996 and canola (Brassica napusL.) in 1997. Nitrous oxide flux from soil was measured using a vented chamber technique and calculated from the increase in concentration with time. Nitrous oxide fluxes for all treatments varied greatly during the year, with the greatest fluxes occurring in association with freeze-thaw events during March and April. Emissions were greater when N fertilizer (100 kg N ha−1) was applied in the fall compared to spring application. Straw removal at harvest in the fall increased N2O emissions when N fertilizer was applied in the fall, but decreased emissions when no fertilizer was applied. Fall plowing also increased N2O emissions compared to spring plowing or direct seeding. The study showed that N2O emissions may be minimized by applying N fertilizer in spring, retaining straw, and incorporating it in spring. The estimates of regional N2O emissions based on a fixed proportion of applied N may be tenuous since N2O emission varied widely depending on straw and fertilizer management practices.

TI  - Effect of tillage practices on the soil carbon dioxide flux during fall and spring seasons in a Mediterranean Vertisol
PY  - 2011
AB  - In this study, we assessed the effect of conventional tillage (CT), reduced (RT) and no tillage (NT) practices on the soil CO2 flux of a Mediterranean Vertisol in semi-arid Morocco. The measurements focused on the short term (0 to 96 h) soil CO2 fluxes measured directly after tillage during the fall and spring period. Soil temperature, moisture and soil strength were measured congruently to study their effect on the soil CO2 flux magnitude. Immediately after fall tillage, the CT showed the highest CO2 flux (4.9 g m-2 h-1); RT exhibited an intermediate value (2.1 g m-2 h-1) whereas the lowest flux (0.7 g m-2 h-1) was reported under NT. After spring tillage, similar but smaller impacts of the tillage practices on soil CO2 flux were reported with fluxes ranging from 1.8 g CO2 m-2 h-1 (CT) to less than 0.1 g CO2 m-2 h-1 (NT). Soil strength was significantly correlated with soil CO2 emission; whereas surface soil temperature and moisture were low correlated to the soil CO2 flux. The intensity of rainfall events before fall and spring tillage practices could explain the seasonal CO2 flux trends. The findings promote conservation tillage and more specifically no tillage practices to reduce CO2 losses within these Mediterranean agro-ecosystems.
